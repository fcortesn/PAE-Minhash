25 hours a day
That's what I need
To show the love that's inside me
Want you so much
I wish that I could hold you near
53 weeks a year

I look at you
And I can't believe 
Those beautiful eyes 
Are starin' back at me
I feel your touch
And it moves me so much
Cuz I feel the love inside you
It took me so long to find you
Now I only wish
That I could stay beside you

25 hours a day
That's what I need
To show the love that's inside me
Want you so much
I wish that I could hold you near
53 weeks a year

When I'm with you
Nothin exists
Except for your kiss
And your tenderness
I never knew
I could love you like I do
But baby you showed me how to
I would be lost iwthout you
Cuz each time you go
You know I think about you

25 hours a day
That's what I need
To show the love that's inside me
Want you so much
I wish that I could hold you near
53 weeks a year

Would never be enough
To show what's in my heart
The one who made my life complete
That's what you are

25 hours a day
That's what I need
To show the love that's inside me
Want you so much
I wish that I could hold you near
53 weeks a year
