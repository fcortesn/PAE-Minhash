(verse 1)  
Girl I been longin'  
to make love to you  
  now were alone  
so if your in the mood  
I will hold you caress you  
  slowly undress you my love  
that's what I'm gonna do  
 
I can teach you things you've never  
known before I know you think  
you know it let me show you more  
Girl I'm gonna satisfy the woman inside  
of you  
That's what I'm gonna do  
 
(chorus) 
Don't you know I'm bout it baby  
I will break you off  
(Bout it)  
Bout it, Bout it, baby, baby no doubt  
ooh we can get it started baby I can set it off  
(yea) 
I'm bout it bout it, girl no doubt about it  
(I'm bout it bout it)  
 
(verse 2)  
What's your desire  
Cause I'll light that fire  
Baby I'm feelin' like  
I just might spend the night lovin' you  
I know you want me too  
 
(Girl I can tell you been waitin'  
to explode, all your fantasies and every  
dream I'll indulge  
Girl I'm only offering the love  
that you been waitin' for  
you'll never ask for more)  
 
(chorus) 
 
I'll put it down to you because it's proper  
and anytime you wanna ride  
jump on girl...  
 
(chorus to end)
