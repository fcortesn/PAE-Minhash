your eyes look through me 
like you knew what I don't 
your smile's so soothing 
when you know 
that I won't turn away 
say good-bye on any future day 
lose myself make you cry 
and run away and hide 
you bring to me security I've never had before 
I'm learning to sleep again 
'cause I know that you are so sincere 
your lying here and never going away 
I can say that today 
I'm the happiest man alive 
without you in my life 
I'd never be the same 
without you in my life 
I'd never feel the same 
now that you're in my life 
I'll never be the same 
now close your eyes 
and listen to the music 
and let it be understood 
that this is how I feel 
without you in my life 
I'd never be the same 
without you in my life 
I'd never feel the same 
now that you're in my life 
I'll never be the same 
oh I'm so satisfied 
with all that you do 
and the way you make me feel 
without you in my life 
and the way you make me feel
