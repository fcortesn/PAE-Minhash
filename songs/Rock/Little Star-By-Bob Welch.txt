Now I don't care if I get burned
Loving you is what comes first
Although you've heard a thousand lies
Please believe me for tonight
Do you know you're magic
Yeah, you little star
Walkin' through the world
Breakin' people's heart
Do you know you're magic
Yeah, you little star
Well, shine on, shine on
Back and forth across my heart
I won't forget you, little star
Little star
I don't care if I get burned
Loving you is what comes first
I don't care if I get burned
Loving you
Although you've heard it a hundred times
Believe me, darling, so have I
But now let's live just for tonight
And let tomorrow take its time
Repeat chorus
Back and forth across my heart
I won't forget you, little star
Little star
