I met a hippy chick, I snuck her into bed 
Didn't think you'd ever know, didn't think you were coming home 
Last night the devil dressed up as a doll 
You woke me with a kick, 
Followed up by repeated hits 
I think I have a broken rib, 
I taste blood upon my lips 
Last night the devil dressed up as a doll 
Please put that gun away, 
I don't even know her name 
She ain't worth dying for, 
It's only you i adore 
Last night the devil dressed up as a doll 
The hippy chick was quick, 
Rolled out of bed lickety-split 
Went through the door without being shot 
Runnin' naked in her Birkenstocks 
Last night the devil dressed up as a doll 
What if I screamed from my knees 
Please don't put those bullets in me 
What if we love instead 
Do you believe anything I've said 
Last night the devil dressed up as a doll
