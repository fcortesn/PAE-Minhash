There's been days I've fallen
And walked away the times I should have stayed.
I looked away, yeah looked away ... so far away -
and when you asked I said I'm not afraid. 

BRIDGE 

But now I can't hold it - hold it
Flash a frozen smile when it boils down inside.
No now I can't hold it - hold it
Just a little crack ...
And then the walls come tumblin' down 

CHORUS 

And I Feel It. It's my time don't try to steal it.
Feel it. Reach inside
Feel it. If you ask well I won't conceal it.
Feel it. I used to wonder but now I finally know ... 

Papa said the sun it also rises.
But when I turn it's falling from the sky.
It slips away - yeah slips away So far away.
And leaves me staring only at the night. 

BRIDGE
CHORUS 

Watch the walls come tumblin' down ...
