She want a string of pearls 
All I got her was a necklace 
Made of flowers from the trash can 
She wanna make me pay for it 
Yeah while I'm at I t guess I'll take another bath man 
And the records out 
Holding steady gaining on last place 
And in a moment's notice 
We'll be ready for the next new phase 
Another stupid craze 
 
She want a string of pearls 
All I got her was a necklace 
Made of flowers from the trash can 
She's gonna make me pay for it 
I start to sing and cry and then it makes me laugh man 
 
Yeah we've all got doubts 
Might not be winning but still in the race 
And in a moment's notice 
We'll be ready for her next new face 
It might be hard to sell 
Still never giving in 
Have I given...so deep...oh..well 
 
Will you give it all to me when you're dead 
You can keep the scent on my pillow 
To settle your broken heart in head 
 
Will you think of me when you die 
Holding steady 
Moment's notice 
Again she left with my heart in hand 
 
She says she hates me 
Yeah she's lied before 
Again it's time to play me 
Yeah it just adds up 
That same sad melodic score 
 
I wrote another one 
Does this one count 
And did it cost as much as all the other ones 
So much more... 
 
She want a string of pearls 
All I got her was a necklace 
Made of flowers from the trash can 
She wanna make me pay for it 
Yeah while I'm at it guess I'll take another bath man 
 
Yeah the record's out 
Holding steady gaining on last place 
And in a moments notice 
We'll be ready for her next new face 
So I state my case 
 
Would you want a string of pearls 
'Cause all I got you was a necklace 
Made of flowers from a trash can 
And she want a string of pearls 
Ain't that enough, ma'am? 
I think it's worth so much more
