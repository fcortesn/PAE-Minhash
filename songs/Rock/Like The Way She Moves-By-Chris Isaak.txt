I met a girl she was half out of her mind, 
That's okay cause I'm half out of mine. 
She said I'm tired of love, all the games, and crying 
And all I want from you is a real good time. 

Said I know how you feel cause I've been there too 
She said you're wasting time we got things to do. 

I like the way you move me, 
I like the way you bring it to me 
Love the way you know what's on my mind. 

I like the way you shake it, 
I like the way you don't have to fake it 
Knew right from the start it would be fine. 

Later
I was laying in bed trying to catch my breath, 
Half ashamed half smiling at the things we did. 
She made it clear from the start it was a one night stand, 
But I was thinking of ways to make her change her plan. 

Nobody else ever made me feel this way 
Sounds shallow well I'm sorry what should I say ? 

I like the way you move me 
I like the way you know how to do me 
Like the way you know what's on my mind. 

I like the way you shake it, 
I love the way you don't have to fake it. 

Knew right from the start it would be, don't you think that we two could be
I'll bet anything that could be fine.
