Out Of Order 

I hear what you're sayin', I may seem out of order 
Nothing's quite the same now 
As it ever was before her 
And you're lookin' at me 
With one of those sideways glances 
You say I'm giving too much 
And takin' too many chances 
But I won't believe you now, I've got to check this out 
And nothin' you can do 
Will convince me otherwise 
You're just tryin' to be a friend 
I know the message is well meant 
But none of it does compare to her eyes 
Just go easy on me, I'm feelin' out of order 
I'm beaten and I'm wounded 
Like I never was before her 
And I know you're talkin' sense 
But I can't forget about her 
You say Im good as dead 
If I keep it up much longer 
But I won't believe you now, I've got to check this out 
And nothin' you can say 
Will convince me otherwise 
You're just tryin' to be a friend 
I know the message is well meant 
But none of it does compare to her eyes 
It may seem unwise, you may be right 
It may seem unwise, you may be right 
But I don't mind, I just can't mind
