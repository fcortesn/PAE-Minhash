High Fives, truly night jive 
living  in the night time 
Soul man, Golden old man 
Weathering  the time sands 

This whole rhythm gives me what I need 
Praying hard as your lifetime 
Praying hard as your lifetime 
Praying hard as your lifetime goes by 

White lines fooling my kind and living for the night time 
Hold hands, home in old land 
weathering the time sands 

This whole rhythm gives me what I need 
Praying hard as  your lifetime 
Praying hard as your lifetime 
Praying hard as your lifetime goes by 

Goes by
