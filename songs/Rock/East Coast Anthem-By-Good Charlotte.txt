Walking on the streets of D.C., 
On the eastcoast where I live, 
You say what's the problem, 
What's with this angry kid?, 
You don't like the way I walk, 
Or the way I talk, 
Or the way I swing my hands, 
You don't like the words I speak, 
Or the thoughts I think, 
And I know you'll never understand, 
You know - on the eastcoast, 
We ride until we die - you know, 
 
CHORUS 
Well there's a place inside my mind, 
Yeah a place you'll never find, 
There's a place inside my mind walk this way, 
There's a place inside my mind yeah a place you'll never find, 
There's a place inside my mind we'll leave today, 
 
 
Wouldn't it be perfect if I could sit with you?, 
And we would, change a thing or two, 
We could change a thing or two, 
We would change the way you think, 
We would change the way I think, 
We can't change the way they think so we're not changing anything, 
 
CHORUS 
 
BRIDGE? 
 
On the eastcoast we ride, 
Until the day we die.
