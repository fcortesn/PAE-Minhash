It's over and I'm overwhelmed
I'm emptied out like a dusty shelf
You buried me-and I'm covered in shame
I'm here but you look right through me 

Pre chorus
Just hear me out for what it's worth
You still rip my breath away
I've come around
I know you've heard it before
And again and again... 

Chorus
Shame on me shame on me
It's bittersweet but I'm so sorry
It took so long but you believed
(I'm sorry it took so long)
Shame on me¡­shame on me...
Because you're every questions answer
Shame on me 

So clever ¨Cbut I tripped somehow
I never guessed you could knock me down
I am just a bit undone
Displaced and burned like fire 

Pre chorus/ chorus 

I didn't get it I never wanted to
My self destructive attitude said
What did you want 
And why would you want it at all?
But you never went away 

You faded out but it took so long
It's tainted 
How could I let this slip away from me
For a wondering jones
I'm here but you look right through me... 

Chorus
