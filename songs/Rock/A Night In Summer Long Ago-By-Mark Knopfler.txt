My lady may I have this dance 
Forgive a knight who knows no shame 
My lady may I have this dance 
And lady may I have your name 
You danced upon a soldier's arm 
And I felt the blade of love so keen 
And when you smiled you did me harm 
And I was drawn to you, my Queen 
Now these boots may take me where they will 
Though they may never shine like his 
There is no knight I would not kill 
To have my lady's hand to kiss 
Yes and they did take me through the hall 
To leave me not one breath from you 
And they fell silent one and all 
And you could see my heart was true 

Then I did lead you from the hall 
And we did ride upon the hill 
Away beyond the city wall 
And sure you are my lady still 
A night in summer long ago 
The stars were falling from the sky 
And still, my heart, I have to know 
Why do you love me, lady, why?
