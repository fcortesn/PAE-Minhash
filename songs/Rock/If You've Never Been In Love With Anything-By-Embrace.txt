Throw me a line and I'll bring you the hook that caught me 
You reel me in to where I cannot breathe 
Throw me back and jump in after me 

It's happened before but I'll see you're never betrayed 
No wrongs to cure or fears to beat away 
And though I'll run I'll never run away 

I know you think that we're all the same and you say 
That you'll love when love comes you're way but today 
We've both got time to spend not waste 

If you've never been in love with anything 
Why do you stop it now it's happening 
And though you know it now you won't admit 
You've ever been in love with anything 

Never before have I had somebody so close 
I'm lying here wondering why you let me go 
You drive your life like it's a car you stole 

You need to be told that you can only live the one life 
Forever starts before the day you die 
If it get hard just take it in your stride 

If you could see the bad in yourself when you see 
All the bad in everyone else and in me 
You wouldn't need to run away
