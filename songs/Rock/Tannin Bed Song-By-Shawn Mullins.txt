Tannin Bed Song 
 
Maria lays in the tannin bed and reads the Tuesday news 
She's down there every week at the same time with the same ol' blues 
She reads the funny papers and then the classifieds 
And if she ain't too sleepy, there's the weather report on the flip side 
And this Kansas life is a hard one for a girl from Miami 
You're just staring out at the oil fields 
And that's all that I can see 
Her old man's in the same place since the company let him go 
Just sippin the pabst blue ribbon and cussin amoco 
Maria drives home from the tannin bed 
And the black clouds roll across the sky 
She pulls into the trailer park, pops the trunk and calls the kids outside 
Said there's a twister comin 
And you haven't got a clue 
I ain't going to sit here in this double wide and wait around for you 
Cause I'm takin the microwave oven 
And I'm takin the color TV 
And I'm packin up the Chevy with the kids and what's left of me 
This Kansas life is a hard one for a girl from Miami 
Just staring out at the oil fields
