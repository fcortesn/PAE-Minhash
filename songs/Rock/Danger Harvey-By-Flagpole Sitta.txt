I had visions, I was in them 
I was looking into the mirror 
To see a little bit clearer 
Rottenness and evil in me 
 
Fingertips have memories 
Mine can't forget the curves of your body 
And when I feel a bit naughty 
I run it up the flagpole and see who salutes 
(but no one ever does) 
 
I'm not sick but I'm not well 
And I'm so hot cause I'm in hell 
 
Been around the world and found 
That only stupid people are breeding 
The cretins cloning and feeding 
And I don't even own a TV

Put me in the hospital for nerves 
And then they had to commit me 
You told them all I was crazy 
They cut off my legs now I'm an amputee, dam_ you 
 
I'm not sick but I'm not well 
And I'm so hot cause I'm in hell 
I'm not sick but I'm not well 
And it's a sin to live so well 
 
I wanna publish zines 
And rage against machines 
I wanna pierce my tongue 
It doesn't hurt, it feels fine 
The trivial sublime 
I'd like to turn off time 
And kill my mind 
You kill my mind 
 
Paranoia paranoia 
Everybody's coming to get me 
Just say you never met me 
I'm going underground with the moles 
 
Hear the voices in my head 
I swear to god it sounds like they're snoring 
But if you're bored then you're boring 
The agony and the irony, they're killing me 
 
I'm not sick but I'm not well 
And I'm so hot cause I'm in hell 
I'm not sick but I'm
