I got a little monkey
His name is Jingy
His first name's Paulo
Middle name is Joe

I call him Paulo Joe Jingy
He's my little monkey
He crawls on my back
And makes himself at home

I got a little monkey
His name is Jingy
He's a pretty little monkey's
Got teeth like dimes

They shine like diamonds
There in the moonlight
They cool my skin
And cut me to the bone

I got a little monkey
His name is Jingy
I got him buried in the backyard
Underneath the onion tree

I can hear him scratching
I can hear him laughing
I can hear him coming on after me
Oh Jingy Jingy Jingy won't you let me  sleep
But Jingy Jingy Jingy'll never let me be
