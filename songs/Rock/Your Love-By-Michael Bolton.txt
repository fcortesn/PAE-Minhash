Oh will someone tell me
What it is I feel
Whatever it is
I know it can't be real
'Cause your love
Is turning me around
I know I'm lost
But I don't wanna be found

Oh, no, I don't believe in love
Honey, I don't believe in love

If I was wise, I'd be on my way
I wanna leave, but I know
I'm gonna stay
'Cause your love is making me lazy
come on inside, Darlin'
Drive me crazy

Oh, no, I don't believe it
I don't believe in love
Honey, I don't believe in love

Is it right, baby, is it wrong
All i know is what I've been hearing so long
I got this feeling and it's much too strong
Baby, it's much too strong
Much too strong

You're everything I ever would need
But what are you doing mama, let me be
'Cause your love is burning like fire
You are my one and only desire

Oh, I don't believe it, I don't believe it
I said, I don't believe in love
Oh, 'cause your love is much too strong
'Cause your love is much too strong

I don't believe it, I don't believe in love
I don't believe it, just don't believe in love
