Las Vegas nights
Have been calling
But I wait to see her float down stairs

There she stands with her eyes full and yearning
I look
And I know gotta be there

Is there another chance
To bring her closer
Make her feel I know we could be happy again

Is there another chance
To bring her flowers
So she will only whisper my name

A chance to make things right for her
And make my lies seem true
I'm begging Do

Don't go down to the station
Somehow we won't live that long
Don't go now, desert flower
Cause you just won't bloom
And your memories made need more room

See that mirror there
Will she look inside
To see the one I fear standing alone

And on my phonograph
Will she put them in 
The songs that only remind her of me

A chance to make things right for her
And make my life seem true
I'm begging Do

[CHORUS]

I step outside The Joint
To clouds of guilt and fear
And there are shades of red dancing in view 

Las Vegas nights
Make me wonder
How much longer I will be a fool 

A chance to make things right for her
Make my lies seem true
I'm begging Do 

[CHORUS]
