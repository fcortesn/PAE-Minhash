Can't remember anything
Is this true or just a dream?
Deep down inside I feel to scream now
But a terrible silence is stopping me

Now that the war is through with me
Waking up, but I can't see
That there ain't much left of me
Nothing is real, nothing is real, but the pain now

And in this womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But I can't look forward to reveal now
Look to the time when I can live

Fed through tube that's stuck in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Can't live and I cannot die
Cut this life off, cut this life off from me

Landmine has taken my sight
And took away my speech
Took away my hearing
Left me with a life in hell

Darkness surrounds me
All I hear and all that I see
Can't live and I cannot die
I'm trapped in myself
Trapped in myself

Landmine has taken, taken my eyes
Taken my hearing
Taken my sight
A landmine has left me with a life in hell
My body my holding cell
And I cannot die

Now the world is gone
Just one
Just one
Hold my breath as I'm wishing for death
Just one, please, God wake me
God help me
God take me
Hold my breath as I'm wishing for death
Please God
Please God take me
Please God wake me
