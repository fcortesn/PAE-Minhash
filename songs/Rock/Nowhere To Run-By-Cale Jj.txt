(J.J. Cale)
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
No way to relieve
This feeling inside
You done gave me them blues
And then you took a ride
Left me with nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Shame, oh shame
On what you do
Can't you see that
I, I, I, been feeling so blue?
Cast a spell on me
Then you took a ride
Left me with nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Pardon me
If I sound so sad
I can't get to you
When I want you so bad
You done gave me them blues
Then you took a ride
Left me with nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
