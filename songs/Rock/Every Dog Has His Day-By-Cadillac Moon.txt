(Noyes, Nugent, Santoriello, Hackford)
Most of the time I'm just an ordinary man. I don't care too much about a
master plan
I've got my work to do and I've got my places to go. Where it all leads to I
hardly ever know
I've learned there's rarely a need for an apology
Every dog has his day but the nights were made for Cats like me
Every dog has his day. Everydog...
I can't recall the last time I felt guilty when I saw the bar clock pointin'
right at 4 A.M.
Life seems to feel so short in the most dangerous times. Five minutes more I'm
gonna cross that fine line
It's just at that moment that you might agree.
Every dog has his day But the nights were made for Cats like me
Every dog has his day Everydog...
There's a little bit of dog In all of us. We blame him for our problems, curse
him for the fuss
One thing is certain every man can say. That he's the only damn dog that will
never stray.
I'm just a regular guy with few crosses to bear. Just tryin' to let the better
side of me get somewhere
But every now and then I feel my spirit sag. Cause the mangy mutt let the cat
out of the bag
I don't know why I keep such bad company.
Every dog has his day But the nights were made for Cats like me
Every dog has his day Every dog has his day
