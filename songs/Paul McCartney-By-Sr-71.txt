Last night I had a dream
It wasn't about anything
But it made me smile
It made me scream

We should take this slow
'Cause I can't let go
When it feels so good
To feel this low

I stumble and she sees all
Waiting for me to fall
Obsessing over her
But it's nothing personal

We should take this slow
'Cause I can't let go
When it feels so good
To feel this low
We'll take our time
Tell each other's lies
In a world so much brighter
If Paul were still alive

Take this slow
Till I lose control
And I'm falling down

Last night I had a dream
It wasn't about anything
I made you smile
I made you scream
