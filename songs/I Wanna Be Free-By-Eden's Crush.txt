I Wanna Be Free 
 
I know he said we'd be together 
In my mind 
And then forever 
But things have changed 
They're not the same 
How can we go on lovin' this way 
 
You say you love me 
But you really don't 
You want to argue 
And I just won't 
It's bad enough 
I have to come home to 
A man who puts me in a real bad 

I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me 
 
I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me 
 
It just seemed fair 
To blame it on you 
All these problems 
That we're going through 
Sometimes it's me 
Who gets you upset 
But when it's you 
You won't admit it 
 
We try to talk but we must understand 
So I stay quiet 
And you get all mad 
It's bad enough 
I have to come home to 
A man who puts me in a real bad mood 
 
I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me 
 
I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me (you're causing me) 

I wanna be free (I wanna be free (repeat in background)) 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me 
 
I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me 
 
I don't know what I'm gonna do 
After all that I did for you (what?) 
Just showed you love 
I stayed true 
But it seems it still won't do 
All you go fussin' and cussin' (uh huh) 
At eachother like we enemies 
Goin' against the grain 
With nothing but negative energy (whatever) 
I'm not saying 
That I ain't got no faults 
And I'm perfect 
But all this stressin' me 
Me stressin'' you 
Tell me is it worth it 
On the phone 
With your friends 
Puttin' 'em in our business 
We might as well go on Jerry Springer 
And get it off the ringer (alright then) 

I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me (why are you causing me? 
 
I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me (eh ehhh ooOooOhhh? 
 
I wanna be free (I wanna be free [in background]) 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me (why are you causing me so much pain? 
 
I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache 
You're causing me (causing me? 
 
I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache (I wanna be free, oOoohoOoh) 
You're causing me 
 
I wanna be free 
From the love 
From the pain 
From the heartache (your causing me, your causing me) 
You're causing me (from your love) 

Your causing me 
Your causing me 
(yeaaa) 
(oooOoh)

Why you causing me so much pain?
