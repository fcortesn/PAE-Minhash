I am lost inside your lair
And allowed you to lure me here
You promised immortality
I've become your newest meat
And I am ripe for the feast
And I am dripping form their mouths
As they say to me:

Well eat what's left of you before we're through

The lust for blood within reach
We've woken under your feet
No longer
Frightened by these vampires 
This situation is clear
No longer clouded by fear 
Like cornered dogs we'll turn and 
Bite the hand that feeds but does not kill

Sleep and dream
Hiding from the day
Pay no mind to shapes that wind
Around you where you lay there will be time for waking
There will be time for taking
But who
But you-
Parasites come in many shapes
And you forgot that we have teeth too
While you were feeding off our blood we
Became one of you
There is something coming that you forgot me friend
The very beast that you create is the one who'll slay you in the end
You thought I'd go down easy
But now you're coming
With me
You'll burn with me
You'll never take us alive
