(feat. Nas)

[JD:]
Y'all know where we takin' this
JE, y'all
Nas {I got it}
So So Def

[NAS:]
I'm nasty (Nasty)
Never let a pretty face pass me (Pass me)
Come on, y'all know when it's easy (Yeah)
For me to get a good girl
Turn her out to sleazy and trashy (Uh-oh, uh)
She's freaky (Freaky), live in the bed (Uh)
Make baby girl eyes roll in her head (Woo)
This is what you need, my mission is to please
Hands to the sky, Nas, JE

[JAGGED EDGE:]
Your girl said you was out lookin' for me
If so, then you need to come and see
If you're ready for a night that you will never forget
I'll give you pleasure and real love if you let me

Baby, tell me what it is
You want from me (Let me know, let me know)
Don't beat around the bush
If you want my body

If you want it, girl, I got it, girl
Come and get with me
Girl, I'll turn your body inside out
And bring ecstasy

If you want it
Baby, come and bring your body to me (Bring your body)
If you need it, girl, I got it, got it (Oh...ooh...)
Got-got-got-got it, come on

Could you follow me, girl
You need to come with me
I've searched all around the world
Finding you is like a dream

When you wake up
You won't feel the same about me
'Cause you'll realize 
You're life won't be the same without me, whoa...

Baby, tell me what it is
You want from me (What you want from me)
Don't beat around the bush
If you want my body

If you want it, girl, I got it, girl
Come and get with me (Oh...oh...)
Girl, I'll turn your body inside out
And bring ecstasy

If you want it (If you want it)
Baby, come and bring your body to me (Bring your body, baby)
If you need it, girl, I got it, got it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got-got-got-got it, come on (Let's go)

Just you (Just you, girl) and me (And me, yeah)
Baby, just bring your body (Bring your body) to me (To me)
Tell everybody (Tell everybody) to come by me
The things I'll do to your body
You'll love me and we can be

[NAS:]
Girl, what's your astrology
Virgo, if so you the same sign as me
Geminis are fly, the kind I need
Love Aquarius and Pisces
Can't leave a Libra
I live life day to day, let a player play
Supportin' my women
All my Capricorns and Scorpio women
Leos and Cancer, girls be bad
Only sign I can't deal with is Sag'
Confusin' my enemies, never losing
Clever movement, act smooth with the women
Be amused by my energy or they choose me
I tell just 'em the music's my remedy
I just swell 'em and leave 'em swollen
Girl, this is something that you need to know

[JAGGED EDGE:]
If you want it, girl, I got it, girl
Come and get with me
Girl, I'll turn your body inside out
And bring ecstasy

If you want it
Baby, come and bring your body to me
If you need it, girl, I got it, got it
Got-got-got-got it, come on

If you want it, girl, I got it, girl
Come and get with me
Girl, I'll turn your body inside out
And bring ecstasy

If you want it
Baby, come and bring your body to me
If you need it, girl, I got it, got it
Got-got-got-got it, come on
