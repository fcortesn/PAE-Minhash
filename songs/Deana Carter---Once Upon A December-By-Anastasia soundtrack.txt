Dancing bears, 
Painted wings 
Things I almost remember 
And a song someone sings 
Once upon a December 
Someone holds me safe and warm 
Horses prance through a silver storm 
Figures dancing gracefully 
Across my memory... 
 Someone holds me safe and warm 
Horses prance through a silver storm 
Figures dancing gracefully 
Across my memory... 
Far away, long ago 
Glowing dim as an ember, 
Things my heart used to know, 
Things it yearns to remember... 
And a song someone sings 
Once upon a December
