What's the problem with the human race
With someone like you
No matter where I turn
I can't escape your double face
Don't want to listen to the radio
Cause they don't know
Or stick around just to hear I told you so
How could we make it without you
I should have known better to doubt you
I thought I'd heard the end of it

And now I know how far you'd go
To be the next freak show
American psycho
Cover of the magazines
Patron Saint to troubled teens
Wish I never heard your name

Tomorrow could be just another day
Means nothing to you
A misdemeanor or a felony, that's ok
Don't want to wait for a second chance
So take a stance
It's your turn for the spotlight, the big dance
How could we make it without you
I should have known better to doubt you
I thought I'd heard the end of it

And now I know how far you'd go
To be the next freak show
American psycho
Cover of the magazines
Patron Saint to troubled teens
Wish I never heard your name

They all want to know
What I already know

What am I supposed to do
When you know that it's all true
That you stole, that you lied
That you knew

Primadonna self absorbed
Wide awake and never bored
Party binge and purge, And see
results of plastic surgery
Spotted at the hottest shows
Interview on Charlie Rose
They all want a piece of you

And now I know how far you'd go
To be the next freak show
American psycho
Cover of the magazines
Patron Saint to troubled teens
Wish I never heard your name

They all want to know
How far you had to go
and I already know
How far you had to go!
