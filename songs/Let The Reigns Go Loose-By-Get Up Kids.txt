(Ahh)
Can you take the bullet back
Change it to a heart attack
my wish, I wonder could it be true
Sick fits form a former home
Wmisfits under mistletoe
One year spent waiting, waiting for you 

[Chorus]
This isn't what i wished for
This isn't what i knew
What can waiting do

Date: Fall 1989 
Daydream of a valentine
I couldn't wait to be added alone
jump forward to twelve years time
those dreams and a sad decline
I'd just thought leaving
Would leave it alone

[Chorus]
This isn't what i wished for
This isn't what i knew
What can waiting do

What did we prove 
Didn't we make this all come true
(I just keep hanging on for more)
Didn't we choose 
(I just keep on waiting at the door)

How did we lose 
Where did we let the reigns go loose
(I just keep hanging on for more)
Didn't we choose 
(I just keep on waiting at the door)

How did we lose 
Didn't we let the reigns go loose
(I just keep hanging on for more)
What if we knew 
(I just keep on waiting at the door)

How did we lose 
Didn't we let the reigns go loose

Can you take the bullet back...
