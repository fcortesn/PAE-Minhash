Now, let's talk about the time I had this morticiachair in my apartment 

Right there in front of the living room as an open invitation to strangers a cold machine might show Smiling like a face, waiting for a telephone call, of a beloved feline 
She is in a state and it's California, she's been there for quite a while 

I've got no presents, I've got no presents 

Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again 
Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again 
Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again 

Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again 
Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again 
She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 
She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 

By the time of my second car crash I got totally wired 
Like in the days I cut myself up with a razor-blade, oh nostalgia 
Lost myself in so many ways I didn't know what to think of him 
Ah, maybe I think to much, I don't think so 

Fell madly in love with a couple of beautiful ears 
It's only a variation 
Had long and boring conversations about nothing 
Talked so much I bored myself to death 
And the more I talk, the more I turn into a vegetable 
God I'm such a fool 

She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 

She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 
I'll behave won't you shame me, I'm into deep, won't you shame me 
She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 
I'll behave won't you shame me, I'm into deep, won't you shame me 
She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 

Taste of orange, orange, little Christ 
I'm in her bath-tub, consulted 
Consulted, consulted, consulted 

She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 

She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 
I'll behave won't you shame me, I'm into deep, won't you shame me 
She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 
I'll behave won't you shame me, I'm into deep, won't you shame me 
She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob 

Information, information 
I'm bored, bored
