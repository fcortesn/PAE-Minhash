I never thought I needed someone
Till you came away.
How I ever lived without you
I don't know to this day.

There were times I could have done letter, I know,
But even when I fail you or your love
Would never let go.

You were there (You were there)
When I needed someone to talk to. (Talk to)
You were there (You were there)
When I could not find my way, oh,
You know you could have given up on me
When you'd see that nobody cared.
You were there!
You were there!

You know I've faced the same temptation
Time and again, (Time and again)
But how could someone leave this warmth
To go out in the rain.

No one else could ever offer me more
Then your love and your understanding,
A love I've never known before.

You were there (You were there)
When I needed someone to talk to. (Talk to)
You were there (You were there)
When I could not find my way, oh,
You know you could have given up on me
When you'd see that nobody cared.
You were there! (You were there!)
You were there! (You were there!)
You were there! (You were there!)
You were there.
