I've been moving far away from you
Baby
I don't wanna see another day
Without You
How Can I even think about anyone else
When you're the only one on my mind

I'm gonna stand by your side
Ill never leave you behind
I'm gonna stay through the night
Cos I know
Ill never be alone

Ive been missing you too many nights
Baby
All alone without you by my side
How Can I even think about anyone else
When you're the only one on my mind
Nobody Else

I'm gonna stand by your side
I'll never leave you behind
I'm gonna stay through the night
Cos I know
I'll never be alone

I'm gonna stand by your side
Ill never leave you behind
I'm gonna stay through the night through the night
Cos I know Yes I Know
I'll never be alone
I'll never be alone

I just wanted for you to stay
That I love you anyway
I just wanted you to stay
Now I know
I'll never be alone

I'm gonna stand by your side
Ill never leave you behind
I'm gonna stay through the night
Cos I know Cos I Know
I'll never be alone
I'm gonna stand by your side to stay
Ill never leave you behind That I Love You Anyway
I'm gonna stay through the night
Cos I know Cos I Know
I'll never be alone
