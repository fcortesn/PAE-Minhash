Little Lady Love  
 
Oh yeah x 5  
 
Chorus 
I'm little lady love  
I've been touched from above  
And you just can't get enough  
Of little lady love  
 
Chorus 
I'm little lady love  
I've been touched from above  
And you just can't get enough  
Of little lady love  
 
We maybe young  
But only for a while  
I may look brave  
But boy that's just my style  
Taken from my teens  
But feeding from the tears  
Falling with the love  
I've holding back the years  
 
Chorus 
I'm little lady love  
I've been touched from above  
And you just can't get enough  
Of little lady love  
 
The miracle of love  
Is something I've observed  
And speaking for myself  
Is something I'll preserve  
Until I feel my way  
Along the sticky road  
I'll save the miracle  
I'm gonna take it slow  
 
 
Chorus 
I'm little lady love  
I've been touched from above  
And you just can't get enough  
Of little lady love  
 
Lady love, lady love  
Lady love, lady love  
Lady love, lady love  
Lady love, lady love, love  
 
I think I've been seperate  
Makes it so desperate  
I think I'll moderate  
Better to wait, it's favourite  
 
Chorus 
I'm little lady love  
I've been touched from above  
And you just can't get enough  
Of little lady love  
 
I'm little lady love  
I've been touched from above  
And you just can't get enough  
Of little lady love  
 
Lady love, lady love  
I've been touched from above  
And you just can't get enough  
Of little lady love  
 
Chorus 
I'm little lady love  
I've been touched from above  
And you just can't get enough  
Of little lady love  
 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah x2
