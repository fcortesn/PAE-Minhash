You're throwin' around a lot of serious accusations 
Ain't too hard to tell what you're insinuatin' 
You think I'm the one who stole her away 
And if not for me she'd still be yours today 
We're both men here so why play games 
Why don't we call a spade a spade 

Man to man 
Tell me the truth, tell me 
Were you ever there when she needed you 
Man to man 
Look me in the eye, tell me 
If you really loved her 
Why'd you make her cry 
Man to man 
Who cheated who 
You're the one to blame 
Tell me it ain't true 
Man to man 
Man to man 

Well you think al you anger is justified 
Me, I think, it's just your wounded pride 
What did you really think she was gonna do 
She's a real woman, not a doormat for you 
You want her back, but it's too late 
Why don't we just cut to the chase 

Man to man 
Tell me the truth, tell me 
Were you ever there when she needed you 
Man to man 
Look me in the eye, tell me 
If you really loved her 
Why'd you make her cry 
Man to man 
Who cheated who 
You're the one to blame 
Tell me it ain't true 
Man to man 

Man to man 
Tell me the truth, tell me 
Were you ever there when she needed you 
Man to man 
Look me in the eye, tell me 
If you really loved her 
Why'd you make her cry 
Man to man 
Who cheated who 
You're the one to blame 
Tell me it ain't true 
Man to man 
Man to man 
Man to man...
