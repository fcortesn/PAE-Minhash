Silence 
Trying to fathom the distance 
Looking out 'cross the canyon carved 
By my hands 
God is gracious 
Sin would still separate us 
Were it not for the bridge His grace 
Has made us 
His love will carry me 

(Chorus)
There's a bridge to cross the great divide 
A way was made to reach the other side 
The mercy of the Father, cost His son 
His life 
His love is deep, His love is wide 
There's a cross to bridge the great divide 

God is faithful 
On my own I'm unable 
He found me hopeless, alone and 
Sent a Savior 
He's provided a path a promised 
To guide us 
Safely past all the sin that would divide us 
His love delivers me 

(Repeat Chorus) 
 
The cross that cost my Lord His life 
Has given me mine 
 
There's a bridge to cross the great divide 
There's a cross to bridge the great divide 

(Repeat Chorus)
