(SOLO DANCE -- VICTORIA) 

MISTOFFELEES:
Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicle cats come one, come all
The Jellicle moon is shining bright
Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball

Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicles come to the Jellicle ball

CHORUS:
Jellicle cats are white and black
Jellicle cats are of moderate size
Jellicles jump like a jumping jack
Jellicle cats have moonlit eyes

We're quiet enough in the morning hours
We're quiet enough in the afternoon
Reserving our terpsichorean powers
To dance by the light of the Jellicle moon

MUNKUSTRAP:
Jellicle cats meet once a year
At the Jellicle ball where we all rejoice
And the Jellicle leader will soon appear
And make what is known as the Jellicle choice
When Old Deuteronomy just before dawn
Through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife
Announces the cat who can now be reborn
And come back to different Jellicle life
Because waiting up there is the heaviside layer
With wonders one Jellicle only will see
Jellicles ask because Jellicles dare
Who will it be? Who will it be?
