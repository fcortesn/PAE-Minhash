Made My World

Sha la la la la. Sha la la la la.
Sha la la la la. Sha la la la la.
I never thought of what I could be, where I'd go, what I'd do.
I never thought of what I should be until You,
You came into my life when I was all alone.
You came down and saved my soul.

When I found my world was crashin',
And I thought I'd lost my passion,
You came and laid a hand on this little girl.
When I thought my dreams were fading,
I looked up and saw You waitin'.
You reached Your hands down and You made my world.
Sha la la la la. (hey) Sha la la la la

I never thought of where I might be if I turned away from You.
I never thought of all I would need without You. (yeah)
You came into my life when I was all alone.
You came down and saved my soul.

When I found my world was crashin',
And I thought I'd lost my passion,
You came and laid a hand on this little girl.
When I thought my dreams were fading,
I looked up and saw You waitin'.
You reached Your hands down and You made my world.
You came down when I was all alone.
You came down, You came down and saved my soul.

When I found my world was crashin',
And I thought I'd lost my passion,
You came and laid a hand on this little girl.
When I thought my dreams were fading,
I looked up and saw You waitin'.
You reached Your hands down and You made my world.

When I found my world was crashin',
And I thought I'd lost my passion,
You came and laid a hand on this little girl.
When I thought my dreams were fading,
I looked up and saw You waitin'.
You reached Your hands down and You made my world.
Sha la la la la. (oh, You made my world) Sha la la la la (You came and changed it all).
Sha la la la la. (oh oh) Sha la la la la (oh oh oh).
