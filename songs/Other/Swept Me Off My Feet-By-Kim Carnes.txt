(Kim Carnes)
Irresistible you I bet you knew
About everything in this world
A winning show lettin' everyone know
They were lucky just to be your girl
I should have know better than
To get mixed up with you
You swept me off my feet
Turned me around
Took my heart and then you took me down
You swept me off my feet
And like a fool I fell
I fell straight to you
Now I can tell ya how it feels
To play the part of the fool
How it feels
To have the heart of the fool
So debonair with a gentleman's flair
You asked me out one evenin'
And though I tried to conceal how you make me feel
You knew just what I was thinkin'
And before I knew it
I was mixed up with you
You swept me off my feet
Turned me around
Took my heart and then you took me down
You swept me off my feet
And like a fool I fell
I fell straight to you
Now I can tell ya how it feels
To play the part of the fool
How it feels
To have the heart of the fool
I guess you pulled it off
You're a winner again
And I've got to hand it to ya
Cause I'm still entranced still romanced
And honey I stil love ya
But I should have known better than
To get mixed up with you
You swept me off my feet
Turned me around
Took my heart and then you took me down
You swept me off my feet
And like a fool I fell
I fell straight to you
Now I can tell ya how it feels
To play the part of the fool
How it feels
To have the heart of the fool
