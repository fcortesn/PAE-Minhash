Paradise Lost 
 
Shhhhh.. be quiet now, be still my darling 
I can see you lying there in your bed 
Even know you're ?only in my head 
I'm so far away X6 

And if you could see what I can see 
And if you could hear me now baby 
And I can tell you this paradise is lost 
Flowers blossom in stone in this place I'm livin lost 
I'm so far away X3 
And what I think I'm trying to say is 
I can't help thinking about you 
And I can't help thinking about every one in you 
I can't help thinking about you 
And I can't help thinking about every one in you 

Do you remember old times my friend 
Who knows good old times 
You seem so distant now 
From these days of mine 
I can see you clearly now 
Joking and drinking wine 
Even know it's only in my mind 

And if you could see me now 
And if you could hear me now my friend 
I can tell you this  paradise is lost 
Flowers blossom in stone in this (soons ?) 
I can I'll be coming home 
I'm so far away X3 
And what I guess I'm trying to say is 
I can't help thinking about you 
And I can't help thinking about every one in you 
I can't help thinking about you 
And I can't help thinking about every one in you 

I wonder what you're doing now 
And whatever you're doing now 
I hope you're alright 
Do you remember that night ? 
That night seems?so far away X3 

And I could see what I can see 
And its only me that can hear me 
And I'm the only one in those 
Paradises lost flowers blossoms in stone (stolen?) 
I wish I was back home X2
