First they told me that they loved me 
dressed me up in the light of gold 
all they wanted was to know me 
gotta get me on before I get too old 

then they told me I was big time 
lots of favors of limosine 
this might be what they told me it would be 
but I'm not sure it's what I need 

Not what I need Now, won't you tell me 
Oh, my lady where's my lady 
all this glory where's my lady 
to share it with me 
oh, to share it with me 

First they told me I could love you 
and then they told me never mind never mind 
Gotta keep those cards and letters 
flowing in my friend 
gotta try and have a real good 
real good time now wouldn't you tell me 

oh my lady where's my lady all this glory 
where's my lady to share it with me 
oh to share it with me 
now won't you tell me 
oh where's my lady all this glory 
where's my lady to share it with me 
to share, to share it with me 
oh my lady
