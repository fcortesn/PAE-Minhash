I found you sitting on a suitcase crying
Beneath my feet I feel the rumble of a subway train
And I laugh out loud
?Cause it's the one thing I hadn't been trying
The train came in breathless
The passenger's restless
You say,  Baby, you'll never change 

(chorus)
You gotta get gone
You gotta get going
Hey, the world ain't slowin' down
For no one


It's a carnival calling out to you
And it sounds like a song
It hits you like scripture
You paint the picture
With colors squeezed from your hand
Weren't you the kid
Who just climbed on a merry-go-round
Hey, look, the world ain't slowin' down


Out on the sidewalk
The pigeons do the moonwalk
I'll be dancing like Fred Astaire
The lampposts are rockin'
The whole town is talking
Like a fool in a barber's chair
And I get the sensation
It's joy and frustration
Like getting caught by a drop of cold rain
Freedom can numb you
When there's no place to run to
It feels just like Novocain


(chorus)


You packed up all your handbags
You're throwing off the sandbags
I let go when you stepped free
I didn't want to lose you
You said,  You didn't choose to -- 
It's just how your karma came 
But thanks for the vision,
And the twenty-twenty wisdom
It hit me like a south-bound train


(chorus)
