It's been a complicated life
Am I clear - can you hear me?
If you can't enjoy the view
Then what else is there?

Well the world felt dresses up
All your friends got messed up
Leaving you alone with nowhere else to turn.

CHORUS
You're fucking it up...it's alright
I hate when you call...cause I don't
Know what to do about it.

What's this life in the fast lane?
Cause I positively can't hang
How you blow your mind every night.
Welcome to the life.

And after all the perfect times
Found yourself disconnected
Leaving you alone with nowhere else to turn.

CHORUS

We're fearful but full
Now pray for us all
I'm sayin'...I know I
Should' a let go...a long time ago...ago

CHORUS
