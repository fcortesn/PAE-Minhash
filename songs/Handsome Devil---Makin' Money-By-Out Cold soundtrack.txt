So you want to be a superstar here's a big big kiss
You want a mess like this 'cuz it's the real deal bliss
You got a face like this boy now you just can't miss
You're smoking cheap cigars and drinking beer like piss well
I'm not me I'm not free
You're not mee you're not free
James Brown don't move like that you got to step and twist
I got a six pack and an 80 proof fist
I get it, it's funny, you know I'm making money
Not summer, but sunny. Cool like the Easter bunny
You get it, I'm on it, I got the milk and honey
You make me laugh - Ha ha ha
You make me laugh - Ha ha ha
You make me laugh - Ha ha ha
I hear you want to be an icon like Madonna (like a virgin)
You ask yourself now do I? do I?
Do I got to be a sucker slaving 9 to 5, and in the 5 to 9
You're fucking busy working overtime
I'm not me I'm not free
You're not me you're not free
You don't got moves like this
You don't got style like this
I'm not faking it, baby I'm making it
I get it, it's funny, you know I'm making money
Not summer, but sunny, cool like the Easter bunny
You get it, I'm on it, I got the milk and honey
You make me laugh - Ha ha ha
You make me laugh - Ha ha ha
You make me laugh - Ha ha ha
