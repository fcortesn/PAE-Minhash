For eternity
Obsessed by thy soul
The life of a sinner
As the storms draws near 
Behold the visions
Awakened to the sky
Filled with flaming thoughts
The storms of what thy fear

What have become
When all is concealed
See the shapes of thy likes
As centuries has failed

Finding through the darkness
The Enigma of thy souls
Takes thee back in ancient times
And reveals the truth

 ....Storms - Are thy weakness
Storms - Are thy faith
Storms - Will reveal to thee,
The secrets of the night.... 

For eternity
The impressions of a dream
The touch of a sinner
Make the storms bleed

Hold the chalice
Awakened to the sky
Filled with burning hopes
And with thy greed

Is this the end
When all is revealed
See the shapes of thy likes
Where centuries has failed
