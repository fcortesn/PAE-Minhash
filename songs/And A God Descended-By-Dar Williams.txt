Step through this trampled wall
The unhinged door betrays it all
That far within our faith we were all waiting 
The broken glass reflects the haze
It shines like endless holy days
Struggling to remember what they're celebrating 

Well, a God descended 
And the reason ended 
His life was lifted just above the law 
And now we have to live with what we did
With what we saw

Well, you mend your clothes and patch your roof
And slivers of God's shattered truth
Grow tender as the grass in clean-swept yards 
But a savior came and told us how
The truth was all around us now
Abandon house and field and gather up the shards

Well, a God descended 
And the reason ended 
His life was lifted just above the law 
And now we have to live with what we did
With what we saw

Well, you build your faith with strength and duty
Build your love but there's a beauty
Well you know the scriptures tell
There are a few shards left in hell
And if we want a god we had to follow, follow him down

Pictures torn out of their frames
And orgies where we lost our names
All were gone with time's real desire 
Well, you ask how God can curse you thus
That's not a question asked by us
We burned our beds and books
We fear we've lost the fire

The God descended 
And the reason ended 
His life was lifted just above the law 
And now we have to live with what we did
With what we saw . . .
