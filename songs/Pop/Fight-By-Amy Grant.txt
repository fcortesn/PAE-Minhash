You know some days I like me.
Some days I don't.
Some days I try with passion.
Sometimes I won't.
I might just hold my guard up,
And lock my heart up tight,
But it's the door that's open,
Letting in the light.
There's a battle raging
Inside of me.
It's a holy struggle,
And it won't let go of me.

No, no, no,
I don't want to stop the fighting,
Wo, wo, wo,
I just want to live right.

I used to sit and ponder
If I'd be fine,
If Jesus lived His own life,
And I lived mine.
But love is such a magnet,
It pulled me night and day,
Until my needy heart
Just couldn't stay away.
Life can drive you crazy,
Or just about.
But even when it's most frustrating,
This kid's not walking out.

No, no, no,
I don't want to stop the fighting,
Wo, wo, wo,
Sure it's tough but I won't deny it,
No, no, no,
I don't want to waste my life hiding,
Wo, wo, wo,
I just want to live right.

I've made up my mind now,
I don't want to lose out, (unguarded)
Beginning to see now,
What the fight is about, (unguarded heart)
I gotta stay open,
Keep defenses all down, (unguarded)
Don't want to be hiding,
When the love comes round.

No, no, no,
I don't want to stop the fighting,
Wo, wo, wo,
I just want to live right.

No, no, no,
I don't want to stop the fighting,
Wo, wo, wo,
Sure it's tough but I won't deny it,
No, no, no,
I don't want to waste my life hiding,
Wo, wo, wo,
I just want to live right.

No, no, no,
I don't want to stop the fight, now,
Wo, wo, wo,
I just want to live right, now.

No, no, no,
I don't want to stop the fighting,
Wo, wo, wo,
I just want to live right.

No, no, no,
I just can't stop the fighting,
Wo, wo, wo,
If I want to live right.

No, no, no,
I don't want to stop the fighting,
Wo, wo, wo,
I just want to live right.

No, no, no...
