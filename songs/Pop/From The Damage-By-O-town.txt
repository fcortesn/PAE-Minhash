This time I'm done with always screwing up
I'm sick of one direction down
I'm a broken picture frame
My whole world's twisted inside out
Streaming voices like a hurricane
It's telling me to wake up
Get out of bed
Put your feet on the floor
There's fresh air out the door

And I've been acting so pathetic
Knocking around like a ball on a string
It's taking time for me to get it
I'm ready and willing to do anything to make it up to you

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty
My heart weighs like a ton cause it feels so heavy
I'm standing here all alone
Wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away
From the damage

Last time I'm playing with a broken string
It don't matter no one's listening
Cause losing you has made me see
I've gotta change
Gotta blame it
All on me

And I've been acting so pathetic
Knocking around like a ball on a string
It's taking time for me to get it
I'm ready and willing to do anything to make it up to you (oh)

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty (so empty)
My heart weighs like a ton cause it feels so heavy (heavy yeah)
I'm standing here all alone
Wishing that I could've known
That you just can't walk away
From the damage (damage)

My eyes may as well be blind if I just can't see you(if I can't see you)
My hands may as well be tied cause they just can't touch you (touch you)

Before the smoke can really clear away
From fires I started yesterday
I know I've gotta find a way
Somehow I've gotta find a way to wake up
From the damage

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty
My heart weighs like a ton cause it feels so heavy
I'm standing here all alone
Wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away
From the damage
My eyes may as well be blind if I just can't see you
My hands may as well be tied cause they just can't touch you
I'm standing here all alone
Wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away
From the Damage

I'm standing here all alone
Wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away
From the damage
