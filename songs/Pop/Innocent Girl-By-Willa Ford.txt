oooohhh oooohhh   
I'm not such an Innocent Girl   
 
First impression   
Can be wrong   
So let me clear what's going on   
Baby I'm not who you think I am  


I need to feel your lips on mine   
So I'm pulling you across the line   
You think I'm the fragile one?   
One step the damage   
oooh oooh   

I'm not made of china   
I'm not made of glass   
Would it shatter your illusions If this angel had a past?   
 
If you touch   
I won't break   
Don't think I'll be that way   
I'm not such an innocent girl   
Don't wrap me up in cotton wool   
Up on the pedestal   
This time I've had it   
I'm not such an innocent girl   
 
I've got a secret rose tattoo   
I'm dying just to show you   
I'm not who you think I am   
Time to take off those kid gloves   
T.K.O me fall in love   
Don't be scared you'll break my heart   
Not gonna fall apart   

I'm not made of china   
I'm not made of glass   
Would it shatter you world   
If this angel had a past?   
 
If you touch me   
I won't break   
Don't think I'll be that way   
I'm not such an innocent girl   
Don't wrap me up in cotton wool   
Up on a pedestal   
This time I've had it   
I'm not such an innocent girl   

If you touch, if you touch me   
I, if touch me I won't break(I won't break)   
If you touch, if you touch me   
I if you touch me, I won't break(I won't break)   
 
ooooooohhhhh 
 
Choros 3x   
 
If you touch me   
I won't break   
Don't think I'll be that way   
I'm not such an innocent girl   
Don't wrap me up in cotton wool   
Up on a pedestal   
This time I've had it   
I'm not such an innocent girl
