It's time to begin - now count it in...
5-6-7-8
[Chorus]
My boot scootin' baby is drivin' me crazy
My obsession from a western - my dance floor date
My rodeo romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine better get in line
5-6-7-8

[Chorus]

Foot kickin' - finger clickin', leather slapping - hand clappin' - 
hip bumpin' - music thumpin' - knee hitchin' - heel and toe - 
floor scuffin' - leg shufflin' - big grinnin' - body spinnin' - 
rompin' stompin' - pumpin' jumpin' - slidin' glidin' - here we go

[Chorus]

Tush pushin' - thunder footin' - cowgirl twistin' - no resistin' - 
drums bangin' - steel twangin' - two steppin' - end to end
hardwood crawlin' - some four wallin' - rug cuttin' - cowboy struttin' -
burnin' yearnin' - windin' grindin' - lets begin the dance again

[Chorus]
You're mine, all mine now bubba
Gonna rope you in - so count me in
5-6-7-8
[Chorus]
