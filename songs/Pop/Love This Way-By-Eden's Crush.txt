I wanna run into someones arms
Lie on a bed of roses
I wanna feel just like juliet
I wanna fall in love
I've got a feeling

Everybody wants someone to love 
Somebody they can trust
Somebody they can touch
Everybody wants to give their heart away
Everybody needs a little tenderness
To feel understood
To feel passionate
Everybody wants to be in love this way
Everybody wants to be in love this way
I know I do what about you

I wanna be somebody's baby
I want to cry and still feel beautiful
Maybe I really just wanna be myself
I'm not the only one
I got a feeling

Everybody wants someonne to love
Somebody they can trust
Somebody they can touch
Everybody wants to give their heart away
Everybody needs a little tenderness

To feel understood
To feel passionate
Everybody wants to be in love this way
Everybody wants to be in love this way
I know I do
What about you
I do I do doesn't everybody wanna give their heart away 
I do I do dosen't everybody wanna be in love this way
Cause I do 

I wanna feel like an angel
I want to fly on a beam of moonlight
I wanna see heaven from the inside
I wanna feel just like juliet
Juliet juliet
