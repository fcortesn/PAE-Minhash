Everywhere I Go 
 
Verse 1 
A good bit of me sleeps underneath in the bed of my soul 
lying next t o belief if I toss where I lay I might turn her away 
So I try to still fall dreamin' someday I will 
wake up with you beside me with all of your love inside me 
so when I am gone it guides me on 
 
Chorus 
Everywhere I go I take you with me sweet darlin' 
Everywhere I go you know I take you with me 
 
 
Verse 2 
A good bit of me keeps to the sky On the back of a cloud Unaware of how high 
If I stay where I lay I might drift away soon 
From the pull of the sun I am full of the moon 
But baby your the one who grounds me When the sounds of this world surround me 
Your love it took a look and found me Lost and on my own 
 
Bridge 
Baby I always try looking at life through open eyes 
Baby my dreams came true with the treasure I found inside of you
