If you break my heart 
A heart that ever, babe, loves you 
How can you mistreat ? 
They want your love 
It's so true, I love you 
Stay with me tonight 
A heart will fall in love, that's right 
Oh, I never can lose 
I never can lose this old game 
It's the same 
Forever and ever again 

Baby, save me - don't break me 
Be my forever, lady 
Hold me - don't break me 
Be tonight my love 

Save me, please don't break me 
Oh baby, never fool me 
Save me, or you lose me 
You'll never, babe, deceive me 

You're the one I want 
Oh you need love, like I do 
You can hurt me more then I'll never babe feel brand new 
That it's true 
My heart belongs to you 
And my heart cries just for you 
Oh, I'll never can lose 
I never can lose this old game 
It's the same 
Forever and ever again
