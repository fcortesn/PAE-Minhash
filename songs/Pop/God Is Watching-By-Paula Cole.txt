Whether it be across the sea, 
Kosovo,Baghdad,Korea 
Or here at home, right under our fingertips 
In new slavery prison systems 

Holding one in four black American brothers 
The one percent wealthy profiteering 
From the buisness that is war 
Yeah,go to war 

God is watching us play our ghetto wars 
God is watching us play our games 
God is waiting for us to overcome 
God is waiting for us to just love one another 
 
Whether we be cracker or black or 
Brown,red,yellow 
From the land or sky or sea 
We are family 
Wake up and see 

Our planet is a tiny atom in god's kingdom 
It's our only home 
A new millennium 
Can we all just get along? 
 
God is watching us play our ghetto wars 
God is watching us play our games 
God is waiting for us to overcome 
God is waiting for us to just love one another
