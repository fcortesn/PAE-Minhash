There You Were 
(feat. Mark Anthony)

I was counting down minutes.
I was wishin' on the stars.
I was prayin' for a sign,
And tryin' to beat the odds.
I was dreamin' of you,
Love lbefore I wsaw your face.
And there you were,
Waitin' for that day.
Then you reached through the hurricane,
When youm baby you called me name.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope zas gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.

Must have broken into heaven,
Just to roll back the douds.
Were you on a mission.
Were tou seekin me out.
Was I that one in amillion.
Was I that one sacred kiss,
That you couldn't chance,
You just couldn't miss.
thenYou whisperes through the silent tears,
When you swept away all my fears.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope zas gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.

Standin' in the middle of nowhere,
With your arms wide open and you,
You were the reason when there was no reason.
In my life
You're the reason in my life.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope zas gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope zas gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.

Like the light in the eye of the storm,
Tellin' me not to cry anymore.
Where I watched my whole world fall apart,
Shinin' through like on angel from afar

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope zas gone,
Where the hero belongs...
There you were.
