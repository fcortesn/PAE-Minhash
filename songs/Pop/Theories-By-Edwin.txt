Jacking up the bean stock from 11am through 7pm and we're holdin up the stall 
thinking no one's looking except you and me at home 
Watching on tv it's not something i wanna see 
it's just cloud in my brain making me insane I just want the peace and quiet of 

(chorus) 
what could never be 
maybe its just me 
i could never find the way back there 
off the wall's the sound of rain 
i've faultered tonight alone 
i bet on fantastic theories (2x) 

avoiding the police man as we're scoping the ground for a place to sit down 
start rolling up a smoke celebrate 4 20 knowing all around the world 

in the senseless scene you take the time enjoy the green get the red in your eye 
watch the world go by lay back and start to dream about 

(chorus) 
but you don't have to see me 

all babies go to heaven 
if things go wrong to soon 
when will your day be comin 

(chorus) 
i bet on fantastic theories 
theories 
i bet on fantastic theories 
theories 
all babies go to heaven 
when things go wrong to soon 
all babies go to heaven 
if things go wrong to soon 
when will your day be comin
