Live And Breathe


You give me strength when I am weak
You mellow my soul with your sanctuary
What else could I do
When all I am is you
You set me free and now I fly again 

We've found a deeper love
And a deeper meaning
And it's like a deeper feeling
A deeper love
And a deeper meaning
And it's right so live and breathe it
Deeper Love (let's get deeper love) 

You made me whole you made me complete
The song of your soul echos in me
What else could it do
When I find myself in you
You give me hope and I shine again 

We've found a deeper love
And a deeper meaning
And it's like a deeper feeling
A deeper love
And a deeper meaning
And it's right so live and breathe it
Deeper Love (let's get deeper love)
