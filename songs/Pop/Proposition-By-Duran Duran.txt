Bring back that child she said spare me the price of freedom
Cold is my baby's head blown by the wind of reason
Even the rage behind cries out to see we're still standing
Under the closing edge pay for the crime of feeling
When all your pride is dead you must be scared instead

A quiet word is my proposition a promise made on a fierce day
A body bleeds for this coalition without surrender if you stay

Show me my youth she cried wasted for desolation
Hold up the sacrafice pull down your institution
Resting while anger flies question's the same who's deciding
After the clouds have lain shame on your generation
When all your guilt lies dead you must be scared instead

A quiet word is my propostion a promise made on a fierce day
A body bleeds for this coaltion without surrender if you stay

When all your pain lies dead you must be scared instead

A quiet word is my proposition a promise made on a fierce day
A body bleeds for this coalition without surrender if you'll stay
A quiet word is my proposition a promise made on a fierece day
A body bleeds for this coalition without surrender if you'll stay
Proposition
