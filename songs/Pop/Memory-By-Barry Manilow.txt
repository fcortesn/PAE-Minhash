Midnight 
Not a sound from the pavement 
Has the moon lost her memory 
She is smiling alone 
In the lamplight the withered leaves collect at my feet 
And the wind begins to moan 
Memory 
All alone in the moonlight 
I can smile at the old days 
It was beautiful then 
I remember the time I knew what happiness was 
Let the memory live again 
Daylight 
I must wait for the sunrise 
I must think of a new life 
And I mustn't give in 
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too 
And the new day will begin 
Burnt out ends of smokey days 
The stale cold smell of morning 
The streetlamp dies 
Another night is over 
Another day is dawning 
Touch me 
It's so easy to leave me 
All alone with the memory 
Of my day in the sun 
If you touch me you'll understand what happiness is 
Look a new day has begun 
Memory 
All alone in the moonlight 
I can smile at the old days 
It was beautiful then 
I remember the time I knew what happiness was 
Let the memory live again
