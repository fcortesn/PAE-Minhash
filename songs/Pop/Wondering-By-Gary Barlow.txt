So there you go again turning love into a question, 
It's not so hard to say if this is for real or rejection, 
Don't make me promises, don't make me decide, 
Don't beg forgiveness just try harder next time, 
I know this love will start 

Don't keep me wondering, 'cause it's hard enough to know, 
Don't keep me wondering, if you've turned cold, 
We've got to work it out, 
whatever's wrong we'll make it right, 
Don't keep me wondering if your love is worth the fight 
 
All alone still waiting, so glad I know that you're worth the chasing, 
Though I understand your reasons, I've never argued or fought with me feelings, 
Don't be protective, don't keep changing your mind, 
You use forgiveness as a way to buy time, 
Don't push aside a love you've never tried, 
Try and see this through my eyes 
 
Don't keep me wondering, 'cause it's hard enough to know, 
Don't keep me wondering, if you've turned cold, 
We've got to work it out, whatever's wrong we'll make it right, 
Don't keep me wondering if your love is worth the fight 
 
Wondering if anything will happen baby, 
Wondering if this will turn out right 
 
Wondering if dreams are dreams forever baby, 
Wondering if love will ever come to life 
 
Don't keep me wondering, 'cause it's hard enough to know, 
Don't keep me wondering, if you've turned cold, 
We've got to work it out, whatever's wrong we'll make it right, 
Don't keep me wondering if your love is worth the fight
