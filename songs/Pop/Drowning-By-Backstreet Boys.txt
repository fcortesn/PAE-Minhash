Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power
To make me weak inside
And girl you leave me breathless
But it's ok
Cuz you are my survival
Now hear me say

I can't imagine
Life without your love
And even forever
Don't seem like long enough

Cuz everytime I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Maybe I'm a drifter
Maybe not
Cuz I have known the safety
Of floating freely in your arms
I don't need another life line
It's not for me
Cuz only you can save me
Oh, can't you see

I can't imagine
Life without your love
And even forever
Don't seem like long enough

Cuz everytime I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You Keep Me Drowning In Your Love
And everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You Keep Me Drowning In Your Love

Go on and pull me under
Cover me with dreams (yeah)
Love me mouth to mouth (now)
You know I can't resist
Cuz you're the air that I breathe

Everytime I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You Keep Me Drowning In Your Love
Everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You Keep Me Drowning In Your Love

Baby I can't help it
You Keep Me Drowning In Your Love

Everytime I breathe I take you in 
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You Keep Me Drowning In Your Love
Everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You Keep Me Drowning In Your Love
