Tick tock 
The moonlight's hummin' 
My finger's on the button and my hob-nob's drummin'
Slow down we're moving too fast 
Better wait a minute make the good times last 
I've learned something bout livin'
You don't get nothing if you don't stop givin' 
We both know that we got so much But there ain't no rush
Wanna love you slowly 
When you slide on down 
Wanna love you slowly Turn that body round 
You won't be able to control me 
When your love slow down 
Wanna love you slowly slowly slowly slowly
Slowly.. 
Hold tight 
Love is all I need I guess it's sweeter when it's more than just a tease
Let me hold you close enough to stick 
Love is an illusion lets play that trick 
Slow hand moving down my back
If you get a chance u feel my heart attack 
Real love has never been a crime 
Wanna take my time
Wanna love you slowly 
When you slide on down 
Wanna love you slowly 
And turn that body round
You won't be able to control me 
When your love slow down 
Wanna love you slowly slowly slowly slowly Slowly...
Aah...Oah...Uah...
Slowly...Aah...Oah...Uah...
Slowly... yeah...Aah...Oah...Uah... 
If you get a chance you feel my heart attack 
Aah...Oah...Uah...
Real love has never been a crime
Wanna take my time 
Wanna love you slowly 
When you slide on down 
Wanna love you slowly
And turn that body round 
You won't be able to control me 
When your love slow down
Wanna love you slowly slowly slowly slowly Slowly...
Slowly...Aah...Oah...Uah...Slowly...Aah...Oah...Uah...
Slowly... yeah...Aah...Oah...Uah...Aah...Oah...Uah...
