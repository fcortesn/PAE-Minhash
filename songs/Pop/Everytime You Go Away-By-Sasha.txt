Hey!, if we can solve any problem 
Then why do we lose so many tears 
Oh, and so you go again 
When the leading man appears 
Always the same thing 
Can't you see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on 

Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you 
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you 

Go on and go free, yeah 
Maybe you're too close to see 
I can feel your body move 
It doesn't mean that much to me 
I can't go on sayin' the same thing 
Just can't you see, we've got everything do you even know we know 

Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you 
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you 

I can't go on sayin' the same thing 
'Cause baby, cancha see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on 

Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you 
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you
