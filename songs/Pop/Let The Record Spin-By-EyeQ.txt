Have you ever been lost? 
Didn't want your direction 
That was your intention 
Are you free can you see 
All the things that surround you? 
Let them astound you 

Let yourself believe in mystery 
When you find yourself in another galaxy 
Go beyond the limits of sanity 
Expand your mind 
Secret hideaways are awaiting you 
If you challenge all the fears that wont allow you to 
Intimidate yourself with something new 

Wou Uh wou uh Wow 

Take a look around and see beyond the things you can't imagine 
Use more than just your eyes 
Senses can hypnotize 
Take a look around and go beyond the limits if you haven't 
Let go and breathe it in 
Let the record spin 

When in France don't just dance 
Kick back relax and enjoy your favorite souffl¨¦ 
Have you tasted your life lately? 
It seems like you could use a little more gravy 

Let yourself believe in mystery 
When you find your self in another galaxy 
Go beyond the limits of sanity 
Expand your mind 
Secret hideaways are awaiting you 
And if you challenge all the fears 
They will allow you to 
Intimidate yourself with something new 

Wou Uh wou uh wow 

Take a look around and see beyond the things You can't imagine 
Use more than just your eyes 
Senses can hypnotize 
Take a look around and go beyond the limits if you haven't 
Let go and breathe it in 
Let the record spin 

Take a look around and see beyond the things you can't imagine 
Use more than just your eyes 
Senses can hypnotize
