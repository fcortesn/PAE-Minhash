Dreams in the night 
Dreams overflow 
Building bridges to each other 
Hearts make the waters flow 

Sunlight and diamonds 
Reflecting hope 
Making journeys to each other 
Going where lovers go 

You were sleeping, I was walking 
To the rhythm of the falling rain 
Too much water, to cross over 
All the bridges falling down 

You sing me songs 
With overtures 
From strange exotic places 
Words I've never known 

Wait 'til the morning 
Don't send me back 
Don't send me back across the rainbow 
No return to where I've been 

You were reaching, I was taken 
To the river in the light of dawn 
Too much water, to cross over 
All the bridges falling down 

Falling down 
Come lie beside me 
Lie beside me now 
Beneath the waves 
Beauty surrounds us
