Lights are down, no one 'round  
But faces in the glass  
Where did they go nobody knows  
But everybody asks  
The one they loved for many years  
Took his show down the road  
But you were told  

All that glitters is not  
All that glitters is not  
All that glitters is not gold  
 
Wedding bells, top hat and tails  
It was the perfect day  
Big diamond ring, she had everything  
But what a price to pay  
Now she sits home by the phone  
He's never there to hold  
But she was told  

All that glitters is not  
All that shimmers is not  
All that glitters is not gold  

Who mends their soul  
With silver thread and pretty golden needles  
Weave through your life some love  

Fancy cars lights up the bar  
He wore the finest clothes  
Fare-weather friends, spending never ends  
He was the man to know  
Someone said the paper read  
His bills he cannot pay  
No one shows, you see  

All that glitters is not  
All that glimmers is not  
All that glitters is not gold  
hmmmmm 
All that glitters is not  
All that shimmers is not  
All that glitters is not gold  

Sew silver thread and golden needles (go ahead)  
Sew silver thread and golden needles  

No, they can't fix you when you feel torn  
And all that glitters is not gold  

MMMMM UH UH UH No UHHHH  
Whoah... 
You are torn....  
 
All that glitters is not  
All that glimmers is not  
All that glitters is not gold  
 
Oh woah Oh no no no no
