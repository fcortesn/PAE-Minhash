You will walk into a room
You've got killer eyes that hypnotise
You're dangerous
Oh yeah, you're dangerous
You've got a snaky kinda strut
It's too hot to touch
Can't trust a thing you do or say
Gotta stay away

One by one
You've gone from man to man
Until your mission is done

[Chorus:]

Jezabel, kiss and tell
You use your body, just to cast
Your spell
And sell your story
You're just a Jezabel, kiss and tell
You ride the headlines like a carousel
Of fame and glory

I'm going down your windin' road
Around those killer curves
That work my nerves
You're dangerous
Slippery and dangerous
You've got a camera down your shirt
You've got a slit in your skirt
For your dirty work tonight
Now ain't that right
Here you come
You've gone from bed to bed to bed
And now the damage is done

[Chorus]

One by one
You've gone from man to man
Until your mission is done

[Chorus]
