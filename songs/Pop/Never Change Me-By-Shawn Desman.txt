We started out fine, I thought you were right
But girl I was mistaken
You criticise me, and all that I do
And the friends I have too
You loved what I did, And all that I said
So why you wanna change me
I see it all now, It's so clear
What you try to do to me

You aren't the same
You want me in chains
Baby no way
No no

[CHORUS]
You can never change me
Never tame me
I'll keep on doing what I do
I thought you knew
So why you wanna change me
Quit bugging me
I'll keep on doing what I do
So it's up to you 

Ain't taking no more, And that's for sure
In case you didn't know that
I'll do what a do, I'll be who I be
Do you even know me
What happen to you, You used to be cool
But now you acting crazy
Quit nagging on me, I got to feel free
So you just have to trust me

You aren't the same
You want me in chains
Baby no way
No no
