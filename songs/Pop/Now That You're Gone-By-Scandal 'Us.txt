Now That You're Gone 
 
Intro 
Oh yeah oh yeah 
O baby baby yeah 
Oh yeah oh yeah 
O baby baby yeah 
Now that you're gone 
 
I don't really need to feel the pain of loving you 
Now that you're gone 
I don't really need sit around and wait for you 
Now that our love is gone 
 
Verse 1 
I never knew that love ever come my way 
Until the day you walked into my life 
Now I see that it ain't 
What it's supposed to be 
You've changed 
You're strange 
Didn't smile when you called my name 
So now you say you've got the game on me 
That's just your way of saying 
You're a waste of time 
You lie I cry 
Even when you knew you broke my heart 
Pack your bags, get outta my life 
Now that you're gone 
 
Chorus 1 
I don't really need to feel the pain of loving you 
Now that you're gone 
I don't really need to sit around and wait for you 
Now that our love is gone 
I don't really need to feel the pain of loving you 
Now that you're gone 
I don't really need to sit around and wait for you 
Now that our love is gone 
 
Verse 2 
Don't say that you'll be there to comfort me 
Cause when it comes to love you're misery 
I play the fool 
For you 
Just like on MTV 
You smiled I cried 
Never knew what it felt inside 
So now you say you've got the game on me 
That's just your way of saying you're a waste of time 
You lie I cry 
Even when you knew you broke my heart 
Pack your bags get outta my life 
 
Chorus 2 
I don't really need to feel the pain of loving you 
Now that you're gone 
I don't really need to sit around and wait for you 
Now that our love is gone 
I don't really need to feel the pain of loving you 
Now that you're gone 
I don't really need to sit around and wait for you 
Now that our love is gone 
Now that you're gone 
Now that you're gone 
I'm saving all my love for someone who's lovin' me 
 
Bridge 
Oh yeah oh yeah 
O baby baby yeah 
Now that you're gone 
 
Savin' all my loving 
Savin' all my loving 
Savin' all my loving for someone who's lovin' me 
 
Savin' all my loving 
Savin' all my loving 
Savin' all my loving for someone who's lovin' me
