You and I  
  
Come to me  
Let me hold you  
So I can feel you breathe  
And see you're real  
I will do what you want me to  
Cuz tonight is yours  
And the world is only you and I  
If I try  
I know that I can build it for you  
Paradise tonight  
 
Chorus  
Baby it's just you and I  
And we've got the lights down low  
Nobody else around  
Something so strong inside  
And it's all for you  
Cuz nobody does like you do girl  
 
You're my everything  
Mountain high, river deep  
I would go anywhere  
I would do anything  
To keep you here with me  
Even in my dreams  
Nothing comes close to you  
Talk is cheap girl let me show you  
If I try  
I know I can build it for you  
Paradise tonight  
 
Chorus  
Baby it's just you and I  
And we've got the lights down low  
Nobody else around  
Something so strong inside  
And it's all for you  
Cuz nobody does like you do girl
