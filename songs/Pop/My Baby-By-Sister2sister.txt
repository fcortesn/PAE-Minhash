My Baby 
 
 
My baby 
The way he treats me 
If you knew 
You'd want him too 
My baby 
There's no-one else who 
Comes close to 
My baby 
 
The way he smiles 
The way he looks at me 
I feel as if my heart 
Is running free 
Free 
 
My baby loves me 
He loves me 
Yeah I know, I know 
'Cause he tells me so 
He says he loves me 
He loves me 
Yeah that's why, that's why 
There's no-one else like my baby 
 
The way he holds me 
If you knew 
You'd want him too 
My baby 
Says I'm the only one he needs 
My baby 
He pulls me close and whispers 
In my ear, yeah 
He says that in my arms 
The world just disappears 
 
My baby loves me 
He loves me 
Yeah I know, I know 
'Cause he tells me so 
He says he loves me 
He loves me 
Yeah that's why, that's why 
There's no-one else like my baby 
 
He's cute and he's shy 
Oh yeah, he's strong and he's kind 
You can see in his eyes 
That he's sweet and he's mine 
Oh, mine 
 
(tells me so) 
 
(no-one else) 
 
I'm talkin' about my baby 
Talkin' about my baby, baby 
Ooh 
That's right 
I'm talkin' about my baby 
Talkin' about my baby, baby
