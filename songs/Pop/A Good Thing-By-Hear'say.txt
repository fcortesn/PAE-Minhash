Do you wanna get to know me 
I got nothing to hide 
That look in your eyes 
Keeps on telling my I'm over-loading 
Cos I got a way of knowing 
How it's going to be 
I just gotta believe 
Come on baby take a chance on me 

(I got something) 
I got something that you want 
(That you want) 
Don't you worry, give it up 

Chorus
Jump on a good thing 
(Good thing)

Know where we're going 
(We're going) 
Ain't nowhere to hide 
We're on a good thing 
(Good thing) 
The groove is gonna get ya now that you know 
(That you know) 
Do you wanna take a ride on a good thing 

Everybody wants to know

What we're doing tonight (get ready) 
Cos they're looking for a good thing baby 
And everybody needs to show 
How they want it to be 
You just gotta believe 
Come on baby take a chance on me
