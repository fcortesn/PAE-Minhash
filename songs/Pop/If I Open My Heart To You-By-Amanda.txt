It's still too soon to call it love  
I know it's more than just a crush  
We're getting closer everyday  
And when you look at me that way  
All I can say...  
 
Chorus 
... is if I open up my heart to you  
I just need to know you feel it too  
Will you be the one to make  
My dreams come true  
If I, if I open my heart to you  
 
I got a feeling this could be  
Something I thought I'd never see  
You're on my mind night after night  
Something keeps telling me  
It's alright  
So give me a sign, so...  
 
Repeat chorus  
 
Middle eight  
You could be everything  
That I've needed  
But I can't take that chance  
Til I know that you're with me  
Til I know what you are feeling  
Til I know just where you stand  
 
Til I know just where you stand  
Will you be the one to make  
My dreams come true  
If I, if I open my heart to you  
Will you be the one there  
To help me get through  
If I, if I open my heat to you
