Doesn't mean I want to be in love
No matter how it seems babe

Give me a chance to explain
Baby don't be thinking I'm in love with you

If I only had the heart to tell you the way it is 
If I only had the strength in me to resist

Could have stopped you then from falling (oh)
If I only had the heart

(If I only, If I only had, If I only had the heart)
