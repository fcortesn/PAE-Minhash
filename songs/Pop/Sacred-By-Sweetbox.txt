Like a wind that's slowly blowing 
Your breath upon my skin softly comforts me 
Like a dream that keeps you lounging 
I just hear your voice and I'm weak 
And I know it's not just passion that's touched me so deep 
Even though I try to hide 
Something's changed in me 

'cause we found something sacred 
I'm not scared anymore 
'cause we found something sacred 
Something we can't ignore 
When so many lovers never find each other 
I've found you 
'cause we found something sacred 
So sacred And sweet 

Like a kiss that keeps you yearning 
When I feel your lips I start to cry 
Baby, put your hands upon me 
Leave me breathless tonight 
I'm alive and unafraid 
Unashamed With you 
When so many lovers never find each other I've found you 
'cause we found something sacred 
So sacred and sweet
