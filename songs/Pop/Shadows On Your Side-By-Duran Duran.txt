Shackeled and raised for a shining crowd
They want you to speak but the music is louder than all of their roar
With the heat off the planet's core

But the shadows are on your side as soon as the lights go down
In the darkest place you can find you belong to the hands of the night

Promises made with a distant friend
Truth should be known it can only bend to a tune of it's own
Hey you'll never hear that voice again
Scandel in white on a tangled vine
With everybody saying that your having the time of your life
When your life is on the slide
But the shadows are on your side as soon as the lights go down
In the darkest place you can find you belong to the hands of the night
Shadows on your side as soon as the lights go down
In the darkest place you can find you belong to the hands of the night

Spinning a compass to choose your way
You can run you can dive you can stand and you can soar
Whichever way you can be sure

That the shadows are on your side as soon as the lights go down
In the darkest place you can find you belong to the hands of the night
Shadows are on your side as soon as the lights go down
In the darkest place you can find you belong to the hands of the night
Shadows on your side
The shadows are on your side
Shadows on your side
The shadows are on your side
Shadows on your side
The shadows are on your side
Shadows on your side
