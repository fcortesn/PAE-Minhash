I've been lookin' for a sign 
Runnin' through the rain 
Shiver to the bone 
But I still can't shake the pain 
I've been lookin' for a sign 
Rollin' on the ground 
What did I do today 
Well, I can't remember now 
I'm just tryin' to survive 
The best way I know how 
My heart just keeps on wanting 
The one who doesn't want me now 
So what if I go crazy 
Goin' there keeps me alive 
Livin' makes it clear 
I'm just stuck right here 
Tryin' to survive 
But I wont stay down long 
And I'll be back again 
I'll even learn to smile 
Hey, I just wish I knew when 
I'm just tryin' to survive 
The best way I know how 
My heart just keeps on wanting 
The one who doesn't want me now 
So what if I go crazy 
Goin' there keeps me alive 
Livin' makes it clear 
I'm just stuck right here 
Tryin' to survive 
So, what if I go crazy 
Goin' there keeps me alive 
Livin' makes it clear 
I'm just stuck right here 
Tryin' to survive 
Yeah, livin' makes it clear 
I'm just stuck right here 
Tryin' to survive
