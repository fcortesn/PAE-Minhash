(J.J. Cale)
If I'm standing in a crowd
Call my name, call it loud
Don't go to strangers
Woman, call on me
Wave your arms in the air
Let me know that you're there
When in doubt
Oh woman, call on me
Don't leave me here to rust
Don't let me turn to dust
Oh, woman
When in doubt, call on me
If I'm standing in a crowd
Call my name, call it loud
Don't go to strangers
Woman, call on me
