I heard you found yourself a new man  
And you say you're happy as it can be  
No one can play the game like you can  
But does he give you everything you need  
But in good time, you're gonna find  
Your eyes were closed 
And your heart was blind  
Now it's too late to change your faith 
'Cause there's no way he'll ever take my place  
  
He'll never be what I used to be to you  
So if you wanna play the fool  
Then make that move  
And do what you gotta do  
You'll never find a heart that is half as true 
I guess you really never know  
But soon you'll see  
That he'll never be what I used to be to you  
  
Does he even have a notion  
Of what you really feel inside  
Are you going through the motions  
Living in a lie like you're satisfied  
But late at night, you realized 
Something telling you it just ain't right  
It's not the same.Am I to blame  
When you're with him, you call my name  
  
(He'll never be me)  
I gave you all my love 
What were you thinking of  
Guess it was just a game  
And it's all the same to you  
Too late to try again  
This story's at an end  
It's time for moving on  
And what you gonna do
