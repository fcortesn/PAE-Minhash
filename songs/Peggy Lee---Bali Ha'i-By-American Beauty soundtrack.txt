Music by Richard Rodgers, Lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II

Most people live on a lonely island
Lost in the middle of a foggy sea
Most people long for another island
One where they know they would like to be
Bali Ha'i may call you, any night, any day
In your heart, you'll hear it call you, 
come away...Come away
Bali Ha'i will whisper on the wind of the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me...Come to me...
Your own special hopes, your own special dreams
Bloom on the hillside and shine in the streams
If you try, you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me...Come to me...
Bali Ha'i...Bali Ha'i...Bali Ha'i
Someday you'll see me floating in the sunshine
My head sticking out from a low-lying cloud
You hear me call you, singing through the sunshine
Sweet and clear as can be,
Come to me...Here am I...Come to me...
If you try, you'll find me,
Where the sky meets the sea,
Here am I your special island
Come to me...Come to me...
Bali Ha'i...Bali Ha'i...Bali Ha'i...
