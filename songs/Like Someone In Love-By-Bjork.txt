lately I find myself out gazing at stars
hearing guitars like someone in love
sometimes the things I do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately I seem to walk as though I have wings
and to sing like someone in love
each time I look at you I'm light as a cloud
and feeling like someone in love
sometimes the things I do astound me
mostly whenever you're around me
lately I seem to walk as though I have wings
run into things like someone in love
each time I look at you I'm light as a cloud
and feeling like someone in love
like someone in love
like someone in love
