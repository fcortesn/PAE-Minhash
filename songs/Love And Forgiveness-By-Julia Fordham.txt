I watch the days and weeks and years roll by
I long since gave up trying to count them on my side
Along with all that I hereby confess
I'm learning how to live on love and forgiveness

Forgive me if I stop and rest awhile
I've walked a long and testing mighty million miles
Here in this little church within a church
I'm learning how to live on love and forgiveness

Love, carry me love, carry me love, carry me love
Carry me love and forgiveness
I'm living on love and forgiveness

I've kissed goodbye to all those little hurts
I sent them up in one big fire I made of words
And in my dealings and in my defence
I'm learning how to live on love and forgiveness

Love, carry me love, carry me love, carry me love
Carry me love and forgiveness
I'm living on love and forgiveness

It could be said
I was choking on my daily bread
I was caught up in a time that seemed endless

Oh carry me love and forgiveness
I'm living on love and forgiveness
I'm living on love and forgiveness
I'm living on love and forgiveness
I'm Living on love and forgiveness
