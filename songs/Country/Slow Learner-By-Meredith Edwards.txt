You said no but my heart said yes 
I couldn't face the truth so I kept on lying 
I love you but you don't love back 
I couldn't deal with that so I kept on trying 
There's no denying that I'm a 

Slow learner 
Can't seem to get it through my head 
Must be a slow learner 
I still ain't got it yet 
I drew a blank on the first time 
A little fuzzy on the second time 
I got a clue on the third time 
Now I'm slowly learning 
You ain't ever gonna love me 

Never any good in chemistry 
That's why it's hard for me to see we ain't got none 
You don't want me I'm a cryin' mess 
I'd listen to my common sense if I had some 
But I'm to in love and I'm a 

Slow learner 
Can't seem to it through my head 
Must be a slow learner 
Still ain't got it yet 
I drew a blank on the first time 
A little fuzzy on the second time 
I got a clue on the third time 
Now I'm slowly learning 
You ain't ever gonna love me 

Yeah I'm very slowly learning 
You ain't ever gonna love me 
Slow learner (repeat till end)
