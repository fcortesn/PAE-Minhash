If you were the ocean and I was a sailboat 
Would I find the gumption to let myself sail 
For lovin' and leavin', you're gone for a season 
Is not what I'm looking for 
 
If you were the laughter I'd hear ever after 
The sound of your voice would make me sing 
For lovin' and leavin', you're gone for a season 
Is not what I'm looking for 
 
I never thought that you would come 
I never thought that I could love like this 
This feeling inside me is growing 
I never thought that you would come 
 
I've been watching the sunrise whether you are the sunset 
And I thought our faces would meet 
But now that I found you 
Like a wave on the sound you've washed my fears away 
 
I never thought that you would come 
I never thought that I could love like this 
This feeling inside me is growing 
I never thought that you would come 
 
You are the voice I hear in my ears 
You are the one that is prone to these tears 
And you are the one that has stolen my heart 
And I'm telling you from the start 
 
I never thought that you would come 
I never thought that I could love like this 
This feeling inside me is growing 
I never thought that you would come 
 
I never thought that you would come 
I never thought that I could love like this 
This feeling inside me is growing 
I never thought that you would come 
 
I never thought that you would come 
I never thought that you would come
