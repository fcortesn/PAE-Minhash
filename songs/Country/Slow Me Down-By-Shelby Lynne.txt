Put me on a boat on the mighty Mississippi 
Let old man river slow me down 
Been too long gone from my sweet dixie 
Chasin' a dream from town to town 
 
So I called my baby in Mobile, Alabama 
Said meet me in Memphis on the Jackson Queen 
Tell you right now we ain't in no big hurry 
To make our way down to New Orleans 
 
Chorus 
Slow me down 
Somethin' 'bout the rhythm and the rollin' of the river 
Slow me down 
Rocks me like a baby in a rockin' chair 
Slow me down 
Sometin' 'bout the smell of a sweet magnolia 
Slow me down 
Makes me forget all my troubles and cares 
Just a few more miles and I'll be there 
 
Well I need a little time for some relaxation 
A little bit of lovin' from my sugar pie 
Only Heaven knows how my heart's been achin' 
For a big yellow moon in a southern sky 
 
(Repeat chorus and 3rd verse)
