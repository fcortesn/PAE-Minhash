Evolution Man 
 
He's a walkin' contradiction when he sings his verse. 
He's got a caffeine fix addiction but it could be worse. 
And he is loved by many understood in time. 
But it's easier to love him than to try to read his mind. 
He's a mass of words expression and toil, 
and his temples in the trees, the water and the soil -- 
he's a man of evolution, always changing like the seasons. 
He finds the right solution but gets lost in his own reason, 
and he's got a ways to go. 
I know he's doing what he can. 
Sometimes this world's a lonely place for the evolution man, 
but she's always been there for him. 
She's his steady ground, and he'll never ever own her, 
it's the other way around. 
'Cause she's the way out of here, 
she's the needle in his vein, 
and he knows she's the only thing that will ever stop the pain. 
He stands there naked in the light giving all he's got. 
Most folks don't understand that 
we're no different than the rocks and stones. 
To the evolution man she said, 
"I got a funny feelin' that I'm headed somewhere new and 
there ain't no use in stealin' your sweet sweet dream from you 
'cause I know you'll find what you want if I set you free... 
and I'll still be here if you find that what you want is me, 
'cause it's a long and lonely road. 
I know you're doing what you can 
but I never thought it would be so hard to love 
the evolution man. 
You're an evolution man."
