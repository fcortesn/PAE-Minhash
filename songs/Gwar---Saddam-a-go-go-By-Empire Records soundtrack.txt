I at the time was a comunist
Lived on a collective farm
She was a part time anarchist
Our sex went off like a bomb
Living the life of a terrorist
Looking for the man Saddam
Who gave me a gun
As Iran to the sun
If you die like a dog
Then you are


SADDAM
HAIL!
THEY SHALL DROWN IN THEIR OWN
BLOOD!
HAIL SADDAM A GO-GO!


Going to Saddam a go-go
Everybody is there
Business of strange bed fellows
Makes you dance around like a bear
Ein, Schwein, kick him in the eye
They were the ones
Who could rice from the sun


As they dived in their planes
And they die!
How they died!


The running paper tiger chases it's own
tail


HAIL SADDAM A GO-GO!


He was someone
Who was there for 
People like me
Hi there Saddam
Love the party
Yes they're all here with me in Saddam


Bloody Saddam
Loves you always
Always a kick
Bloody Saddam
Even though the 
Smell is making me sick
As we sit on our roofs
And cheer as your
Scuds fall like rain


Here at the ancient ziggataut
Saddam is presiding there
Running around with a saxaphone
Where is the president where?
Here it comes the black tornado
Let's have a cheer for Sarejavo
If you survive what
Falls out of his mind
You'll make the political world
