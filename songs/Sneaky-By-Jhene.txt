B2K
It's Lil' Fizz 
With my cousin Jhene
This is incredible right here
T.U.G
Yeah

[Chorus:]
Sneaky 
When your with me 
Freaky 
Oh I can't believe it 
How you got me 
The way you got me 
I don't know 
Keep sneakin 
Creepin 
I be beepin 
Why you think that your sneakin on the low 

[Verse 1:]
I ain't gonna trip 
Or act a fool
When you get home late at night
Cause it ain't no reason for me to blow my cool
As long as you get there alright
The ladies keep staring
Boi you know I ain't caring
And it doesn't make a difference to me 
If you want to be sneaky I'll be sneaky too 
Cause I ain't the type that's going to be chasing after you (your so.......)

[Chorus:]
Sneaky 
When your with me 
Freaky 
Oh I can't believe it 
How you got me 
The way you got me 
I don't know 
Keep sneakin 
Creepin 
I'll be beepin 
Why you think that your sneakin on the low 
Sneaky 
When your with me 
Freaky (Well be both creapin)
Oh I can't believe it 
How you got me 
The way you got me 
I don't know 
Keep Sneakin 
Creepin 
I'll be beepin (be beepin)
Why you think that your sneakin on the low

[Verse 2:]
Wanna be all up in your face
Like the other girl may do
I don't really even care what the others say
As long as you can come and chill with your boo
You keep on flirtin (flirtin)
And I know one thing for certain
That you'll be coming back to me
When its all said I know I'll be number one
But until then keep on creepin having fun (your so...........)

[Chorus:]
Sneaky 
When your with me 
Freaky 
Oh I can't believe it 
How you got me 
The way you got me 
I don't know (I don't know)
Keep sneakin 
Creepin 
I'll be beepin 
Why you think that your sneakin on the low 
Sneaky 
When your with me 
Freaky 
Oh I can't believe it (can't believe it)
How you got me 
The way you got me 
I don't know (I don't know)
Keep sneakin 
Creepin 
I'll be beepin 
Why you think that your sneakin on the low

[Hook:]
Boi you think that you so slick
I'm loving every little bit of it
Don't really matter that much to me
You can do what you please (do what you please)
Keep it moving
I see what you doing
Don't change your personality
You can be who you wanna be

[Fizz Rap:]
Well, no need for an introduction
Its your 10 o'clock breaking news interruption
Lil' Fizz has girl hearts hard pumpin
Thats right
Its crazy how I keep these flows bumpin
In a game a year
I'm already in the lead
There is no space in my bed
Waiting for trouble follow me
I'm just
To hot to touch 
To hot to hold
Still tryin to sneaky shorty behind the bundle load

[Chorus:]
Sneaky 
When your with me 
Freaky 
Oh I can't believe it (I can't believe it)
How you got me 
The way you got me 
I don't know 
Keep sneakin (sneakin)
Creepin (creepin)
I'll be beepin (beepin)
Why you think that your sneakin on the low 
Sneaky (you'll be sneakin babe and your creapin babe why you sneaking babe)
When your with me 
Freaky 
Oh I can't believe it 
How you got me 
The way you got me 
I don't know 
Keep sneakin 
Creepin 
I'll be beepin (I'll be beepin)
Why you think that your sneakin on the low 

Why you think that your sneaking
Why you think that your creeping
Why you think that your sneaking
