All I Ever Wanted
All I ever wanted was
I don't wanna lie
All I ever wanted was
A shot that I never got
All I ever needed
No one ever cared
All I ever wanted was
Someone take me outta here 

All I ever wanted was for me to be a myth
Hidden from the land of the bliss
I'm constantly dissed and pissed off
My mindframe shackled to the floor
And I can't move even a little
All I ever wanted was a noose to hang from
And then I show all of u bitches where I came from
The carnival is comin
U can see it in my eyes screamin at the top of my lungs
I wanna die
U couldn't see it with your glasses on
Without a witness doing shit on my lonely and then I'm gone
All I ever wanted was to flip the script
U pull a gat on me and Ima break both your arms bitch
Eastside represent about the killas drug dealas
Put your hands up if u feel us
And I don't give a fuck about u bitches spreadin hate
Cuz most of u hoes will be dead at 28 

All I ever wanted was
I don't wanna lie
All I ever wanted was
A shot that I never got
All I ever needed
No one ever cared
All I ever wanted was
Someone take me outta here 

All I ever wanted lemme kick back and remanice
Only a few things I can think of on my list
A new meat cleaver with an edge like a razor
And a windpipe connected to a hater
It's all I ever wanted, I ain't askin for much
A handle with an axe on the end of my clutch
And then swing it down with all that I've got
Into the ground and  (chop)
Hatchet rydas and juggalos come with us
We gonna blow the other side the fuck up
Douse that bitch with gas give me the matches
I got somethin for all they asses
Listen to em now pleadin' for they life
Talkin bout they were wrong and always knew we were right
Light the molietof
All we ever wanted starts happening now 

All I ever wanted was
I don't wanna lie
All I ever wanted was
A shot that I never got
All I ever needed
No one ever cared
All I ever wanted was
Someone take me outta here 

All I ever wanted was a chance to shine
I wasn't askin for much I just wanted mine
I don't even have a clue what went wrong
I just knew I wouldn't let the shit slide for long
Tell me somethin who the fuck you laughin at
What the fuck u thinkin don't you see this bat
Tell me what the hell is stoppin me from crackin your dome
From smackin your dome till it ooze like foam
All I ever wanted was an eye for an eye
Ima taste your soul when I swallow it live
Turn around wasn't lookin diggin in your locker
as soon as you Looked up whack that's when I gotcha
Crack smack it rack it again
Kept thumpin and skull til it finally caved in
It looked like spaghetti in a broken bowl
I guess I lost control it's all I ever wanted though 

All I ever wanted was
I don't wanna lie
All I ever wanted was
A shot that I never got
All I ever needed
No one ever cared
All I ever wanted was
Someone take me outta here 

All I ever wanted was to scare you to death
Choke your fuckin neck until your ass is outta breath
All I ever wanted was to hear you scream
You know it's hard to sleep when you're controlled by your dreams
The man in the mirror knows that vanity's a must
But will he understand and become like one of us
Paintin up his face, not givin a fuck
Grabbin' his nuts and expectin bad luck
All I ever wanted was a brand new axe
Strictly for the purpose of choppin and splittin backs
All I ever wanted was to watch you bleed
For the cause of the underground in which I believe
I'm a maniac But u don't understand
My axe keeps swingin like blades on ceiling fans
I could show u everything that u can't see
But all I ever wanted to be was just me
