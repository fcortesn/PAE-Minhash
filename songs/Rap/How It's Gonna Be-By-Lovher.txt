Verse 1
It's his way of livin'
Who am I to tell him
That what he's doin' just ain't right
Standing on the corner hustlin'
All day gamblin' under street lights
Even though he's thuggin'
I love him
And I want him in my life

Chorus
No matter what people say
I'm gonna love him anyway
Cause he does a lot for me
And that is why I'm gonna be
A lover, a friend, a soldier, til the end
And that's how it's gonna be

Verse 2
Mother and my father don't understand me
They think I messed up my life
But I don't agree
They need to mind their business cause it's my life
And even though he's thuggin'
I love him (she loves him)
And I want him in my life, life again

Chorus

Bridge
So what you sayin', I can't love him
Cause he's a hustler out her thuggin'
I know you're waitin', sittin' around hopin' that 5-0 come and take hime away
Well even if they do
I'll remain true to love him
In the end

Said I'll be a lover, a friend, a soldier, til the end
And that's how it's gonna be

Chorus 2X and fade
