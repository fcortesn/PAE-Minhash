On anyone for anything or for the fuck of it
We be the underground, we stay beneath
And sufficate hoes like you when y'all asleep

And everybody on the north, east, west and south
Y'all better get it up, y'all better represent this shit

You know I ride with the tokah
Quick to make the pappah
Lift this 10 rollin' dirty police in the road block
Niggas have to swallow drugs
Niggas have to fake they mugs
Niggas put they cideron
Claimin' they fuckin' cella phone
All the time we mighta got it
Say they search us on a hella party

Been underground with the dirt in my eyes for many years
Do the math muthafucka, you can't see the mix
We don't die, we mutiple with the triple 6

Gotta get it quiero
Drop the flower pierro pot on the plat premiero
Redrum I'm head up on the miero fuckin' with the devil
Quote, but they call me lord, copped out very paranoid
All g's in the mode, triple 6 is in the vocal cord
Marijuana scores like a choice runnin' intercourse
You gonna feel the force of the triple 6 is always on
You don't wanna play in here, if I was I'm dumpin' shells
Tie you to the rail, bitch I'll make you a funky smell 

Formation a point of view
I'm asking you how does it feel
To have to will, to rather steal
And shoot it until you kill
Anybody Killa spinnin' twiztid with the three six
Where's it goin' down 
I guess right here so where it's at
Runnin' with the hatchet
Phamtom swollin' in the back

Bumpin' underground everytime we slip into your town
