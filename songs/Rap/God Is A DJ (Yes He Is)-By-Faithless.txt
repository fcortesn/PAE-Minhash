This is my church 
This is where I heal my hurts 
This is my church 
This is where I heal my hurts 
This is my church 
This is where I heal my hurts 
 
It's a natural grace 
Of watching young life shape 
It's in minor keys 
Solutions and remedies 
Enemies becoming friends 
When bitterness ends 
 
This is my church (2x) 
This is where I heal my hurts 
For tonight 
God is a DJ 
 
This is my church 
This is where I heal my hurts
