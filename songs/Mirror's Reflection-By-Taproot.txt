Mirror's Reflection

I'm your mirror's reflection 
What you don't like about me is what you hate in yourself 
You should see through others eyes 
Before you go ahead and make 'em feel like shit 
Stop it but you won't because you hate yourselves 
Images 
Bitch, sometimes I get so frustrated 
Haunting visions in the back of my mind 
Oh, you struck a pose with your hand 
Extended open arms in an idiocratic way 
You try to lie to yourselves 
But you can't break through that sacred wisdom of your spirit 
Used, freak 
Sometimes I would give anything just to be somethin more than nothin'
