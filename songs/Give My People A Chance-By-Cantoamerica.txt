IF I DIDN'T HAVE TWO EYES TO SEE
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT A THING
WHEN I SEE MY PEOPLE SUFFERING
CENTRAL AMERICA BURNING IN WAR
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LONGING FOR PEACE
WHY DON'T THEY LET US BE
WHEN IS THIS CONFLICT GOING TO CEASE
THERE'S STILL TIME STOP THE CRIME
IT'S TIME TO GIVE MY PEOPLE A CHANCE
A NOBEL PRIZE, A PLAN OF PEACE
TONS OF ARMS AN ARSENAL OF TEARS
WHY DON'T THEY LET US BE
GENERALS OF WRATH, THE MICE AND THE CAT,
SHOOTING MY PEOPLE IN THE HEART
WHEN IS THIS CONFLICT GOING TO CEASE?
THERE'S STILL TIME...
RIVERS OF COCAINE BRINGING PAIN
ALL THE WAY FROM COLOMBIA TO THE STATES
STRIKING COSTA RICA ON THEIR WAY.
POLITICS AND SNOW HAND IN HAND
INDIANA FARMERS CORRUPTING THE LAND
WHY DON'T THEY GET OUT OF OUR WAY
THERE'S STILL TIME...
