I won't forget you
I won't
I won't forget your smile
Or how you taken me
Oh how you taken me
I won't forget 
I let you walk with me
Ahh take me home
Because the night
Is so dark
When your alone
I let you down
I let you down
I let you go

Oh won't you let me be
Myself
I wanna be
Myself
I won't forget you
I won't forget you

I let you down
I let you down
I let you go
