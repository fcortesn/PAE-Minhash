Give your body to me, give your body to me,
Let your body be free, free your body, your body with me.

I want to undress you, wanna caress you,
Don`t wanna be coy, it`s time to get me off.

Come on my baby, thrust me, trust me, get me off,
You`re my poison and I cannot get enough.
Get me off (gettin loose), you got to get me off.

Give your body to me, give your body to me,
Let your body be free, free your body, your body with me.

Coz the music's pumpin and I wish you'd do the same to me,
You're so freaky, treat me, make me come, oh baby, baby please.
