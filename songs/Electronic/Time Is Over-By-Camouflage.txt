Once upon a time,
I was free and no one knew,
just where or how to find me.
But this time has passed,
now there is someone,
who can reach me here, there, and everywhere.
Did you think we wouldn't get you;
Don't you know this was wrong?
I'll present you the first prize,
you're the chosen one,
whose game is up!
Whem my time has come,
I'll rise up to the sky,
watch the sunshine,
shine for me all the time.
All the angels sing,
followed by the Holy hand,
to bring me a message:
Did you think we wouldn't get you,
Don't you know this was wrong?
I'll present you the first prize,
you're the chosen one,
whose game is up!
'Cause time is over
(we were waiting for so long)
Time is over.
(declarations made quite wrong)
Time is over.
(We insist on what you own)
Time is over.
