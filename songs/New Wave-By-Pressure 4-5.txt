Pick a point now slowly spin around it
Seems you're lost, so glad to see you've found it
Anything that makes you more than human
Breech the new attack until you feel the...

Wind is blowing you away
So hold onto my hand
Won't let you blow away
Don't be a martyr, yeah

Pick a point now just rotate around it
Feeling high but knowing that you're grounded
Stupid man in stupid clothes is selling flashing lights 
And lies until you see the...

Wave is washing you away
So hold onto my hand
Won't let you wash away
Don't be a martyr, yeah

In a clearing of my conscience
A wave to take us there
'Cause we're drowning
In creation
It's washing you away

'Cause we're drowning in creation
So breathe to feel the wind
Is blowing you away
So hold onto my hand
Won't let you blow away
In a clearing

It's the price you pay
To let it stay this way
In so many works, it's blowing you away
