In methadonia, they weeble and they wobble 
but they don't fall down 
You see, the fed has got their back 
and they say it's better than crack, plus 
it keeps them mellow and passive. . . 

And takes them to the land of Methadonia. 

There are three around my way, all day I 
see them stray, up the block and down the 
stairs, comin' in groups and leaving in pairs 
like suckers. With their weeks supply 
I and I see them selling the elixir of life 

And takes them to the land of Methadonia. 

I see you hangin' on my stoop, you better 
swoop before I do, some jammies in your eye 
because the place in which you're sent 
by your liquid orange friend has kept you 
from it for so long 

And takes them to the land of Methadonia
