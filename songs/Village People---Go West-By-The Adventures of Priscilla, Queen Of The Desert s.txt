Together we will go our way, together we will leave some day. 
Together your hand in my hand, together we will make the plans. 
Together we will fly so high, together tell our friends goodbye. 
Together we will start life new, together this is what we'll do. 

Go west, life is peaceful there. 
Go west, lots of open air. 
Go west to begin life new. 
Go west, this is what we'll do. 
Go west, sun in winter time. 
Go west, we will do just fine. 
Go west where the skies are blue. 
Go west, this and more we'll do. 

Together we will love the beach, together we will learn and teach. 
Together change our pace of life, together we will work and strive. 
I love you, I know you love me; I want you happy and carefree. 
So that's why I have no protest when you say you want to go west. 

Go west, life is peaceful there. 
Go west, lots of open air. 
Go west to begin life new. 
Go west, this is what we'll do. 
Go west, sun in winter time. 
Go west, we will do just fine. 
Go west where the skies are blue. 
Go west, this and more we'll do. 

I know that there are many ways to live there in the sun or shade. 
Together we will find a place to settle down and live with the space 
without the busy pace back east, the hustling, rustling of the feet, 
I know I'm ready to leave too, so this is what we're going to do, 

Go west, life is peaceful there. 
Go west, lots of open air. 
Go west to begin life new. 
Go west, this is what we'll do. 
Go west, sun in winter time. 
Go west, we will do just fine. 
Go west where the skies are blue. 
Go west, this and more we'll do. 

Go west...(repeat   fade)
