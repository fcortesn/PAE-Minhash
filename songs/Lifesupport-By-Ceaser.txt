Shoot it like a gun
For you've never been so wrong
You've been taken it too far
Only out to survive
And it's heavy to endure
Yeah, we need a lifesupport

And every single day, came as it was
It's only fair to say, leave me out for a while
Cause it's heavy to endure
You're way beyond repair

And the price you have to pay
Seems a bit too high for me
I will never ever blame you
We're only out to survive
It's heavy to endure
Even harder to ignore

But I ain't got no medicine
No, I ain't got no medicine
You see you're like a setting sun
Only out to survive
Cause it's heavy to endure
We need a lifesupport

Lalalala, lalalala, lalalala
Lalalala, lalalala, lalalala
