Running out of ways to run 
I can't see, I can't be 
Over and over and under my skin 
All this attention is doing me in! 

Fuck it all! Fuck this world! 
Fuck everything that you stand for! 
Don't belong! Don't exist! 
Don't give a shit! 
Don't ever judge me! 

Picking through the parts exposed 
Taking shape, taking shag 
Over and over and under my skin 
All this momentum is doing me in! 

Fuck it all! Fuck this world! 
Fuck everything that you stand for! 
Don't belong! Don't exist! 
Don't give a shit! 
Don't ever judge me! 

You got all my love, livin' in your own hate 
Drippin' hole man, hard step, no fate 
Show you nuthin', but I ain't holdin' back 
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack 
When I get my hands on you 
Ain't a fuck thing you can do 
Get this cuz you're never gonna get me 
I am the very disease you pretend to be 

I am the push that makes you move
