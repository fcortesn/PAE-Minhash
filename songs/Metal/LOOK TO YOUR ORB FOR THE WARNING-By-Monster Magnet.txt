Goin' down now

The mountain screamed three times today
I guess it thought i like to play
How much does one have to pay
To fry a peak and melt away
Launching titan's breath on mine
The sweating measure lands on time

And the old man, down by the river
Well he walks up and he walks on down
To the spaceship that's parked at your doorstep
And it's waiting to take you away now

Goin' down now

Looking for the rat that crowed
He's hooked up down to Mexico
Slap my nerve now, give me more
It's my disaster friend, not yours

And the old man, down by the river
Well he gets up and he walks on down
To the spaceship that's parked at your doorstep
And it's waiting to take you away now

It's down by the river, it's always this way now
It's down by the river, it's always this way now
Goin' down now, goin' down now
