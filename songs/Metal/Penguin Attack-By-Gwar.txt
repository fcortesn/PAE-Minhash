THEY ATTACK
THEY ATTACK
They are on a rampage
Unleashed from ancient time
Stumbling from the ice age
Marching side by side
Beaks of steel are flaming
Women are enraged
Sky of death is flaming
Women get engaged
They were born of atomic steel
Life and death to them seemed so unreal
Slashing at the ramparts
Hurling ton's of shot
Shopping now at Wal Mart
Smoking tons of pot
They are on a rampage
They were first to fight
They would write a new page
If they could only write
They were born of atomic steel
They attack
Life and death to them was so unreal
They attack
C'mon baby, kick 'em in the ding - ding
Trouble on the double's what it b-b-b-b bring bring
They were born of atomic steel
They attack
It's a penguin attack
So get back
They were born of atomic steel
Life and death to them was so unreal
They attack.
armored phalanxes
flanking maneuvers
vomiting terror
Gibsons and Hoovers
Blasted by fusion
Kicked in the head
just to make sure
we chopped up their dead
It's a penguin attack
They were born of atomic steel
Life and death to them was so unreal
Stumbling from the ice age
They were last in flight
They would write a new page
If they could only write
Rumbling from the ice age
They were last in line
They would start a new age
If they could just take time
It's a penguin attack
C'mon baby, kick him in the ding-ding
Trouble on the double's what it b-b-b-b-bring bring
They attack
It's a penguin attack
They were born of atomic steel
They attack
Life and death to them was so unreal
They attack
