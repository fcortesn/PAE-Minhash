Breathe...
Push...
...I lost you, you were my god thought what do I do now
you were never there for me never there to carry me,
26 years looking back that time is gone it was you I believed in look
what you've done to me realize what you've done to

Me

I can't see going on in this darkness I'm blind beneath my cradle the
bough has broke, I exorcise my loss your lie the punishment

It takes time to try to mend the wounds of all the suffering,
What do I do now all I'm asking from you please send me a sign to
guide me through the times that lie in front of me I'll get by
myself

Look at me now, a piece of shit like you.
Look at me now, you left me so fuck you.

Everybody leaves me, everybody's gone.
Watch my father leave me, there's nobody left.
Feels like I've never been loved.
Everybody leaves me, never gave a shit about me.
Everybody's gone, I'll rot in my head alone.
I don't give a fuck about you, go the fuck away .

Fake being, inside of my heart you are the liar.
Innocence displaced.
Been left.

Here I stand now and I'm alone,
With no one to comfort me.
One set of footprints in the sand.
No one to take my hand, I'll .
I'll walk through as long as I need.
I'll drift through my life though I'm alone.
Outgrown the cradle that once housed me
And I've found that all I need is
Me.

Found I've never needed you to push through
All the shit that stacks up inside of my life.
Endless plight that circulates through my body.
I'll keep stumbling, beating, pummeling
Teething on the rind and renounce my being.

I can't see going on.

I can't see
I'm so tired, of trying to mend the wounds of all my suffering.
What do I do now
All I'm asking from you please,
Send me a sign
To guide me through the times that lie in front of me.
I'll get by myself

I can't see going on fuck it.
