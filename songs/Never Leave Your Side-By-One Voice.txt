I know you're feeling down
Because she broke your heart
Don't think that it's the end you just gotta try and start
Over with someone
Someone who's gonna care
Care about the way you feel when no one else is there
But you gotta be patient because
Love takes some time
And you always gotta be on guard cuz true love is so hard to find
Never know who or where how or why
When the woman you've been waiting for is right before your eyes

[Chorus]

Whenever you're lonely
You can call on me
Cuz I promise to be there until eternity
If the mountains may fall
And the sun refused to shine
I'll be with you through it all
Whenever you hold me
I get a rush inside
You could tell by my touch that I just can't hide
They way I feel about you just feels so right
Baby I will never leave 

[2nd Verse]

So open up your eyes
And let your mind free
What you've been searching for is all disguised in me
So don't you be afraid
Cuz I won't let you down
Sweet love and honesty In you I finally found
I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your dreams at night
Don't ever have a doubt cuz the feeling's oh so right
To have you here with me feels like you're heaven sent
And since you've been with me I've been in love ever since

[Chorus]

Whenever you're lonely
You can call on me
Cuz I promise to be there until eternity
If the mountains may fall
And the sun refused to shine
I'll be with you through it all
Whenever you hold me
I get a rush inside
You could tell by my touch that I just can't hide
They way I feel about you just feels so right
Baby I will never leave your side

Baby...Baby...Baby...I'll be with you through it all...baby...baby...baby...
Baby I will never leave your side
