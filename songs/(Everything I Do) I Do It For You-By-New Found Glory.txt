look into my eyes - you will see what you mean to me search your heart - 
search your soul and when you find me there you'll search no more 
don't tell me it's not worth trying for you can't tell me it's not worth dying for you 
know it's true look into my heart you will find there's nothing there 
to hide take me as i am take my life i would give it all i would sacrifice 
don't tell me it's not worth fighting for i can't help it there's nothing 
i want more you know it's true everything i do - 
i do it for you there's no love like your love and no other could give more love 
there's nowhere - unless you're there all the time - all the way...
