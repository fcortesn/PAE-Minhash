[Chorus]
Baby it's yours
No one does it better
Baby it's yours
Make it last forever 
You know that it's yours
Long as were together
Baby you can rest assure
It's yours, it's yours

I never thought it would happen to me
I never thought I would feel this way
But you kissed me and suddenly 
Now I'm going crazy
(going insane out my mind)
You're all I'm thinking of
There's nobody in the world 
Who means as much
(the only one that I adore)
There's no getting over
What's in your mind

[Chorus]

I never thought that you would be mine
I never thought that we'd be cool
But since you came into my life
I only think about you
(baby it's true all the time)
Can't get you off my mind
The only place I wanna be is by your side
(you're everything I dream and more)
The one I adore
So what I'm saying, it's yours

[Chorus]

Who is on your mind
When it's late at night
When you're in your bed
And it's your time
Don't try to deny
I know you're thinking about me all the time
Baby boo, I'm hooked on you
And I know I got you feeling it 
(feeling it)
All I'm looking for one that I adore
So baby it's yours

[Chorus]
