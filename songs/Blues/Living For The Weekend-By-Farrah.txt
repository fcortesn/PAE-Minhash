He's not a guy that you'd call understanding
She sees him weekends just to keep her hand in
He's not affectionate and won't be kissed
He never cried when they saw Schindler's List. 
He never acted on some great ambition
His hair was ginger but he called it titian
When he admitted that he loved the mission, he had to go. 
She's living for the weekend
Going up the west end
Waiting for her two day paradise. 
He admitted he'd been scarred in childhood
Born in poppleton and moved to foxwood
The other children thought that he talked funny
He bought their friendship with his pocket money. 
He always thought he had a head for business 
Coz he bought multipacks of king sized rizzlas. 
You couldn't blame a girl for feeling listless, he's got to go. 
She's living for the weekend going up the west end
Waiting for her two day paradise
She's going up the west end, Friday night is when she comes alive. 
She's living for the weekend, going up the west end, waiting for her two day 
paradise. 
She's living for the weekend
You're living for the weekend, living for the weekend
We're living for the weekend
