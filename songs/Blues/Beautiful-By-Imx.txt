Chorus: 
Your so beautiful 
Beautiful to me 
Your so beautiful 
God sent you here for me 

1st verse: 
How could I have known my love for you 
Would grow into something so beautiful 
We started out as friends but now 
My love to you I found 
So sacred and so true 
I promised all my love to only you 

Your so beautiful 
Beautiful to me 
Your so beautiful 
God sent you here for me 

At night I pray we'll meet and always stay 
And when I say 'I love you' 
In a special way, hey hey 
With this ring 
Now walk wit hme down the aisle 
Always faithful never untrue 
I wanna spend my life with only you 

Your so beautiful 
Beautiful to me 
Your so beautiful 
God sent you here for me 
Your so beautiful 
Beautiful to me 
Your so beautiful 
God sent you here for me 

(Batman) 
Let me break it down 
Romeo, tell her how I feel 

(Romeo) 
I just love the way you make me feel 
I just wanna listen to the music 

(Batman) 
I just wanna listen to the music 
And think about your pretty smile 

(Romeo) 
I just think about you and only you 
Your so special to me 
I just love you 
Please, don't you go nowhere 
Just stay by my side 

Your so beautiful 
Beautiful to me 
Your so beautiful 
God sent you here for me 
Your so beautiful 
Beautiful to me 
Your so beautiful 
God sent you here for me 
Your so beautiful 
Beautiful to me 
Your so beautiful 
God sent you here for me
