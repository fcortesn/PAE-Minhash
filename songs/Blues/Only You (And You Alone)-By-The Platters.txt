Only you can make this world seem right 
Only you can make the darkness bright 
Only you and you alone 
can thrill me like you do 
and fill my heart with love for only you 

Only you can make this change in me 
for it's true, you are my destiny 
When you hold my hand 
understand the magic that you do 

You're my dream come true 
my one and only you 

Only you can make this change in me 
for it's true, you are my destiny 
When you hold my hand 
I understand the magic that you do 

You're my dream come true 
my one and only you 

One and only you
