Guide me O Thou great Redeemer 
Pilgrim through this barren land. 
I am weak but Thou art mighty 
Hold me with thy powerful hand. 
Bread of heaven 
Feed me now and evermore 

Open now the crystal fountain 
Whence the healing streams do flow, 
Let the fiery cloudy pillar 
Lead me all my journey though, 
Strong Deliverer 
Be Thou still my strength and shield. 

When I tread the verge of Jordan 
Bid my fears subside 
Death of death, 
And hell's destruction, 
Land me safe on Canaan's side, 
Songs of praises 
I will ever give to thee.
