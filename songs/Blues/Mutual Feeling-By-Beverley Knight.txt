You're the one for me, I'm the one for you 
It's a mutual feeling, the feeling is mutual 
You're the one for me, I'm the one for you 
It's a mutual feeling, the feeling is mutual 

I knew the feeling was mutual 
When I first laid my eyes on you 
There was nothing anyone could do to change my mind 
I could tell we would do just fine 

As long as you love me truthfully 
Nothing can divide us, no-one in between us 
The way I feel is so strong 
you're the one I really need 
Make your loving real 

Together love can be beautiful 
I know you're feeling the same way too 
There's only few that can understand what we have 
Except that they'll never catch the vibe 

As long as you can see ain't no time for "3" 
Nothing can divide us, no-one in between us 
Cuz when you're down in my groove, baby 
I'm the only one you need, it's the place to be
