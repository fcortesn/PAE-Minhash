A wall of denial
Is fallin' down
Wo it's fallin' so hard
Down to the ground
Never knew something so strong 
Could be washed away by tears
But this wall of denial 
Was just built on fear

We've all had our demons 
From the garden of white lies
Dressed them amused them 
Pullin' wool over our eyes
Go so far as to love them 
To keep from letting them go
All the while they we're killin' us 
But we couldn't let it show

No matter what the trouble 
We carry round inside
We're never safe from the truth 
But in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial 
Comes tumblin' down
Down to the ground

Simple things in life 
Bring the greatest pleasure
A smile, a kiss 
A little baby's laughter
It makes no difference 
If we run away in fear
The little things in life hold us so near

No matter what the trouble 
We carry round inside
Never safe from the truth 
But in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial 
Comes tumblin' down
Yeah this wall of denial 
Must tumble down
Down to the ground
