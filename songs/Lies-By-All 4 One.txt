You said he was a friend to you
      He was someone that you could talk to
      But for me it wasn't hard to see
      That you were spending more time with him than you were with me
      Then you said it was all in my head
      Just another illusion
      Messin' with me instead of the truth girl
      What to do girl, lying, scheming all the time and it was you girl
      
      B- section 
      Can't you see, what you've done to me
      
      Hook Lies are all you ever gave to me
      This love that we shared was just to fantasy
      Why did you try to comfort me
      When you knew that the truth would set you free
      Girl I tried to give you all my love
      But now I realize that it was not enough
      All of those times that you said you loved me
      All Lies
      
      You tried to play me like a fool
      You were runnin' game
      I was on to you
      Every time that the phone would ring
      I would pick it up
      He would say nothing, still you said that it was all in my head
      Just another illusion messin' with me instead of the truth girl
      What to do girl, lying, scheming all the time
      And it was you girl

      Now it's time for me to see goodbye 
      
      Hook 
      
      Lies are all you ever gave to me
      This love that we shared was just to fantasy
      Why did you try to comfort me
      When you knew that the truth would set you free
      Girl I tried to give you all my love
      But now I realize that it was not enough
      All of those times that you said you loved me
      All Lies
      
      Bridge 
      
      Girl I gave you all my heart and my soul
      And all the love inside of me
      Was there at your control
      Tell me why you do these things to me
      Messin' round with my best friend
      Then you turn around and lie to me
      
      Solo
