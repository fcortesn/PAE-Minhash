Got my Visine 
Got my box 
Got my wishes 
Got my underwater cymbal filled with energy 
To get me through this minute 

TV star from my childhood 
Come and screw me now 
I am man enough for wooden benches 

Seal this note with my juicer 
Use the liquid from your womb 
Season to taste 

Romeo came with crystal 
Said my house is clean except for this 
And I held up my marijuana 
If you think it's a crime 
I'll take a piss 
A piss on your grave 

Had a dream 'bout Joseph Stalin 
Was his son haulin' out of Moscow 
On a jelly bean with wheels 
There is one thing we have in common 
It's the torture of growing old 
You must stand there now 
You must agree 
The time is near now 
We're children no more 
No more 
No more 
No more 
No more 

The ozone like a clit 
Dripping sunshine on my lips 
Call me social disaster 
There's still me comin' after 
A piss on your grave 

Got my Visine 
Got my box 
Got my wishes 
Got my underwater cymbal filled with energy 
To get me through this minute 

My wishes 
This minute 
My wishes 
This minute 
My wishes 
This minute
