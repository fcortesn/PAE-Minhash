Halloween

Hey little dreamer's eyes open and staring up at me 
Oh, little lovely eyes, oh, radiant 
Wait until I come and I will steal you 
Wait until I come I'll take your soul 
Wait until I come and I will steal you 
Wait until I come and I will go 
 
I will dream within the night 
Shadows on the windows 
Lead our love 
Every love will lead me on tonight 
I will lay you lying, 
I will not within this life 
 
Oh, little dreamer eyes open and waving here 
Wait until I come, I see him with you 
Until I come, I'll leave with me 
Until I come, I do come, love... 
 
We will leave it all behind 
Oh, and in the nightmares, 
I'll fill them in good time, oh 
They will 'seech your mind 
And no lying, and you may, well, ask, 
"Why do we run around here? 
Oh, while you come inside me 
Oh, why does it rip me all between?" 
Why then, why then, watch this little fuck! 
 
Going away, yeah... 
Why this lonely, why this lonely, why this lonely, love? 
Why this lonely, why this lonely, why this lonely, love? 
Halloween. 
Carry on, burial, burial, burial, burial, burial 
And let them see 
But tell us, are you satisfied with fucking? 
Don't walk away, don't walk away, don't walk away 
I'm talking to you 
Lovey dove, lovey dove, love is hell, love is up to you 
Love, love, love, love is up to you 
Love, love, love, love is up to you 
Fuck! 
 
In the sky it is wrote 
Up from the ground, 
I stay out of breath 
I felt the temperature rises 
And I felt across the creeping (???) 
(4:27 "Fucking asked for it, mother fucker!") 
These graves... (Who knows...?)
