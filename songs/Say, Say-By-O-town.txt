Are you thinking what I'm thinking
Every little moment
Every special word
Has so much meaning that I'm feeling you're completing my world
But I've tried to say this so long
But the words don't come when you love someone
It's just too hard to say 
How do I say, say
Say this to you
How do I prove my love
(How can I prove my love)
How do I say this to you
How do I prove my love 

How do I say, say
Oooh yeah
