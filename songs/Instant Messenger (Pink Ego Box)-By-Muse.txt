It's gonna be ok
I can't afford another day
At 50 bytes per second

I've never seen your face
I've never heard your voice

But I think I like it
When you instant message me
With a promise
I can feel it 
I can tell you're gonna be
Just like me

My eyes are gonna strained
My heart is feeling pain
At 50 beats per second

I've never seen your eyes
I've never heard your lies

But I think I like it
When you instant message me
With a promise
I can feel it
I can tell you're gonna be
Just like me
Just like me

You tell
You tell
You tell my name
