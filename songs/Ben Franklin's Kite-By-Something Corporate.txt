Give me an answer 
Why this cancer eats me away 
How this restlessness 
Could turn into a day. 
I fear what comes first 
The things that hide in the night 
But I'm quaking, and shaking 
Even now that it's light 

And no I don't feel right 
I can see but I've lost my sight 
I'm high, so high 
Like Ben Franklin's Kite 

And maybe you'll find me 
On another lonely street 
By the smell of summer, 
after she rains 
Maybe you'll loose me 
All together in her heat 
Let this humid air 
Take away my pain 

And no I don't feel right 
I can see but I've lost my sight 
'cause I'm high, so high 
Like Ben Franklin's Kite 

Maybe you're weary 
You always stand so tall 
Maybe you, holier than thou 
Will make me crawl 
I don't claim to be better 
I don't think that you do 
But see I'm weak and incessinct 
My addictions the proof 

And no I don't feel right 
I can see but I've lost my sight 
I'm high, so high 
Like Ben Franklin's Kite 

And maybe I'm crazy 
But lightning might strike me tonight 
And Maybe I'm crazy 
But lightning might strike me tonight
