The color of my hair is changing, my skin is soft 
too soft for a man my age, and I am never alone 
Where is time taking me 
Nothin is real, this is how I feel 
And nothing is wrong but everything takes too long 
How did this end up me against you 
With everything that I say, and everything you do 
Your smile is changing yea, where is time taking you 
Cause nothing is real, this is how I feel 
And nothing is good, but I don't mind being blind 
if you don't mind doing time 
Nothing is wrong but everything takes too long 
Hey by the way, when I fell to your 
waste side, did I crash or just slide 
Hey by the way, when I pulled myself up 
To your waste side did I hurt you or just slide in 
So this is how it feels to get a little older 
and some would say wiser 
But we know what that means, maybe not 
when maybe that's what that means, maybe not 
Cause nothing is real, this is how I feel 
And nothing is good, but I don't mind being blind 
if you don't mind doing time 
Nothing is wrong but everything takes too long 
Hey by the way, when I fell to your 
waste side, did I crash or just slide 
Hey by the way, when I pulled myself up 
To your waste side did I hurt you or just slide in
