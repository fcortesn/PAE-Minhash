let's all go to the underground,
some kind of social lost and found
check all your baggage at the gate
makin sense at 6 but i won't by 8
pulled like a magnet to the door
the faces are new but you've seen them before
spit out the truth that we're scared to say
that's why we come here anyway

i like to live where the lights are low,
sometimes i feel there's nowhere to go.
set you alight and i'll set you free
you never meant that much to me.

a couple shots and we're feelin straight
we shoot it up cause i hate to wait
we're talkin shit and we talk it loud
the seedy kids are my favorite crowd
well write your number down for me
to end up on the floor i guess it ain't meant to be
what's her name well i'm scared to say...
that's why i came here anyway

what's my game you don't want to know
i took too much and i'm feelin low
set me free cause i'm on my knees
it's such a bitch you're so hard to please
