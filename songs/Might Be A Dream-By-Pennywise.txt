The look in your eyes tells me you can't disguise why won't you try and face the truth
You're stuck nowhere I can see that you don=t care
It doesn't seem like it means much to you
I'm sick of listening to you whining It might be a dream instead it means nothing
It could be everything you wanted it to be It might be a dream instead it means nothing
It could be everything you wanted it to be It might be a dream
I see you everyday wasting your time away
afraid to try afraid to lose
don't know why you can't see you could have everything
or nothing at all it's up to you
you've always got to keep on trying
You know you're life could be all you want it be keep getting closer day by day
Images in your head and they wont go away
if you don't try you'll only fail
