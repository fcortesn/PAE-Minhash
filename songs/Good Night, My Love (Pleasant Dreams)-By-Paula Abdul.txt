Words and Music by George Motola and John Marascalco 
 
Good night, my love 
Good night, my love 
 
Good night, my love 
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight my love 
May tomorrow be sunny and bright 
And bring you closer to me 
 
Before you go 
There's just one thing I want to know 
Is your love still warm for me 
Or has it gone cold? 
 
If you should awake 
In the still of the night 
Please have no fears 
I'll be there 
You know I care 
Please give your love to me, dear 
 
(repeat first verse) 
 
Good night, my love
